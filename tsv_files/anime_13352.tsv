Shouta no Sushi: Kokoro ni Hibiku Shari no Aji	Special	1	10/11/1999	-	222		0	13358	15744	Shouta no Sushi is about a young boy who dreams of being a sushi chef just like his father. The anime steps away from the competitive nature of the manga and focuses on self-sufficiency and policy issues of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in Japan in order to educate the population (as it was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) using the popular franchise as a proxy.
