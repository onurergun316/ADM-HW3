Chao Zhi Neng Zu Qiu	TV	52	06/02/2010	06/02/2010	1048	6.27	450	7341	11075	As we enter the 21st century, the relationship between sports and technology is getting closer and closer. Sports products are enhanced by technological advances. The designs of footballs and football shoes require detailed information and computer tests in order to produce products that will allow us to reach the full potential and beyond. If we were only reliant on human testing, the standards would definitely fluctuate greatly. Thus, Professor GGO was brought in as consultant in the research, and as a result GGO robotic footballers were created.(Source: GGO Football Website)	 	['Shawn', 'Isaac', 'Cat', 'Timmy', 'Karl']	[]
