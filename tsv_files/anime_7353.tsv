They are unexplainable, inescapable, and undefeatable. Be prepared, or you may become their next victim.Sit back in terror as traumatizing tales of unparalleled terror unfold. Tales, such as that of a cursed jade carving that opens holes all over its victims' bodies; deep nightmares that span decades; an attractive spirit at a misty crossroad that grants cursed advice; and a slug that grows inside a girl's mouth. Tread carefully, for the horrifying supernatural tales of the Itou Junji: Collection are not for the faint of heart.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Tomie', 'Other: Tomie']	['Tomie', 'Tsujii, Souichi', 'Yotsutsuji no Bishounen', 'Fuchi', 'Oshikiri, Tooru', 'Yuuko', 'Evil Man', 'Ringmaster', 'The Woman Next Door', 'Fukata, Ryuusuke']	['Suegara, Rie', 'Mitsuya, Yuuji', 'Midorikawa, Hikaru', 'Koyama, Mami', 'Shimono, Hiro', 'Nazuka, Kaori', 'Ebara, Masashi', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki']	[['Tagashira, Shinobu', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Gouda, Hozumi', 'Sound Director'], ['JYOCHO', 'Theme Song Arrangement, Theme Song Composition, Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics'], ['The Pinballs', 'Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Composition']]
