Easy Cooking Animation: Seishun no Shokutaku	TV	25	07/05/1989	07/05/1989	315		0	15516	14356	Something like cooking contests in anime form. Approximately three minutes long per episode, in each story there is an evaluation judgement about preparing home food. The preparation is described as humorously as possible. Funny wordplays are often mentioned several times in a consequence and are particularly salient but are repeated in a merry way.(Source: AniDB)	...	[]	[]	NA
