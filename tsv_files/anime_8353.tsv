Kataku	Movie	1	01/01/1979	-	2121	6.07	655	8356	9283	Many years ago, a young woman named Unai-Otome lived in the village of Ikuta. As she was beautiful it was no surprise that she had two suitors, both deeply in love with her. The girl was torn apart over which one to choose. In her desperation she chose a third option - taking her own life. Although her intentions were absolutely pure, not even in death did she find the solace she desired. Many decades later, a pilgrim walking by her grave meets a beautiful young woman and her story once again rises from the depths of time.... With a plot based on a classic play of Noh traditional theatre, the film presents the peak of Kawamotoâ€™s mastery thanks to its expert mediation of the absurdity of the human condition.(Source: Karlovy Vary International Film Festival)	...
