Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera	TV	12	04/08/2011	04/08/2011	16287	6.51	5062	6092	4385	Meet the Demon Patrol: a hotheaded demon prince; a sultry, half-naked ice princess; a lusty frog-demon spy; a talking wizard hat... and one little girl. This rag-tag group has been charged with the protection of Earth from a multitude of demons who would love nothing more than to bring their world crashing down around them. They'll face off against a vengeful squid, a somnambulant kitty cat, a pot full of snakes, a night-stalking deciduous, a hater of crotches, and even a literal butthead! Descend into an unreality filled with pratfalls, lewd behavior, and enough obscure cultural jetsam to drown us all!(Source: NIS America)	['Adaptation: Dororon Enma-kun', 'Alternative version: Dororon Enma-kun']	['Enma', 'Yukihime', 'Fudou, Harumi', 'Chapeau-jii', 'Kapaeru', 'Enpi-chan', 'Chiiko', 'Sutten Douji', 'En Tengu', 'Kan Tengu']	['Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Inaba, Minoru', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Shishido, Rumi', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Otsuka, Chikao', 'Ginga, Banjou']	[['Yonetani, Yoshitomo', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard, Theme Song Lyrics, Key Animation, Series Composition'], ['Takadera, Takeshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Ishiodori, Hiroshi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Harada, Nana', 'Episode Director']]
