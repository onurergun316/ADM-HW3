Ajin Part 1: Shoudou	Movie	1	11/27/2015	-	40981	7.48	14850	1673	2776	For high schooler Kei—and for at least forty-six others—immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.Sadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.(Source: Vertical)	['Adaptation: Ajin', 'Sequel: Ajin Part 2: Shoutotsu', 'Alternative version: Ajin']	['Nagai, Kei', 'Kaito', 'Satou', 'Shimomura, Izumi', 'Tosaki, Yuu', 'Ogura, Ikuya', 'Tanaka, Kouji', 'Nakamura, Shinya', 'Nagai, Eriko', 'Keisuke, Nakajima']	['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Hosoya, Yoshimasa', 'Ootsuka, Houchuu', 'Komatsu, Mikako', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Kinoshita, Hiroyuki', 'Hirakawa, Daisuke', 'Kaji, Yuki', 'Suzaki, Aya']	[['Seshita, Hiroyuki', 'Director'], ['Andou, Hiroaki', 'Director'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['ryo-timo', 'Episode Director']]
