True Tears	TV	13	01/06/2008	01/06/2008	197963	7.33	92462	2257	912	Shinichirou Nakagami was living the life other boys from his grade could only dream of—staying under the same roof as prodigal student Hiromi Yuasa. However, the bright and cheerful Hiromi has been depressed and cold at home ever since her mother passed away. While he is the subject of the ignorant jealousy of his peers, rumors begin to spread when Shinichirou meets Noe Isurugi—a girl known for cursing classmates, curses which always end up becoming reality.Noe curses Shinichirou as well, but two pits are created when you curse someone, and her curse on Shinichirou comes back to bite her in the form of a raccoon to her beloved chicken, Raigomaru. Despite this, she does not shed a single tear; Noe had had her tears stolen. For Noe to be able to cry again, she would need the tears of another, and Shinichirou knows a person whose tears he wants to take away.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Spin-off: True Tears: Mini Chara 4-koma Gekijou', 'Sequel: True Tears Epilogue', 'Other: True Tears: Raigomaru to Jibeta no Monogatari', 'Character: Utopia', 'Summary: True Tears Recap']	['Yuasa, Hiromi', 'Isurugi, Noe', 'Andou, Aiko', 'Nakagami, Shinichirou', 'Isurugi, Jun', 'Nobuse, Miyokichi', 'Takaoka, Rumi', 'Nakagami, Munehiro', 'Kurobe, Tomoyo', 'Nakagami, Shiori']	['Nazuka, Kaori', 'Takagaki, Ayahi', 'Iguchi, Yuka', 'Ishii, Makoto', 'Masuda, Yuuki', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Miruno, Jun', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Watanabe, Tomomi', 'Takahashi, Rieko']	[['Horikawa, Kenji', 'Producer'], ['Nishimura, Junji', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Wakabayashi, Kazuhiro', 'Sound Director'], ['Andou, Masahiro', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
