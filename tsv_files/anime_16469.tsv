Kabi Usagi (2016)	ONA	1	06/26/2016	-	263		0	16475	15086	"Four years after the original Kabi Usagi shorts, a new episode was released. This was longer than the original, contained smoother animation, was fully voiced (unlike the original which has no voice acting), and numbered as ""story 01."" A series/additional numbered shorts were expected under this franchise revival but it never came to fruition after this first episode."	['Other: Kabi Usagi']
