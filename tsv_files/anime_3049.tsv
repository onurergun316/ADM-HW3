Meanwhile, Haru stumbles upon Natsu, who is struggling with motion sickness.

To make matters worse, Natsu learns of Haru's relationship with her and suspects them to be accomplices.In this crossover between two popular series, Fairy Tail x Rave follows the two groups as they discover their similarities with each other.
