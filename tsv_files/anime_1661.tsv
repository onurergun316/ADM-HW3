Acchi Kocchi (TV)	TV	12	04/06/2012	04/06/2012	280150	7.49	126279	1660	618	Feelings may come and go, but true love always remains in the heart. Tsumiki Miniwa is in love with her best friend, Io Otonashi. For her, confessing is nearly impossible; but to her friends, they seem to be the perfect match. Cute and petite, Tsumiki comes off more as a friend, and Io's attitude toward her is friendlier than toward others. Despite the constant teasing and obvious hints that his friends have been dropping, Io always seems to miss the signs. Throughout her everyday school life, Tsumiki spends time with her friends and Io. Will she finally muster enough courage to confess her true feelings?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Acchi Kocchi', 'Sequel: Acchi Kocchi (TV): Place=Princess']	['Miniwa, Tsumiki', 'Otonashi, Io', 'Katase, Mayoi', 'Haruno, Hime', 'Inui, Sakaki', 'Inui, Miiko', 'Sakimori, Saki', 'Sakuragawa, Kikue', 'Saibara, Kyouya', 'Miyama, Kana']	['Ookubo, Rumi', 'Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Fukuhara, Kaori', 'Asanuma, Shintaro', 'Minaguchi, Yuko', 'Takamori, Natsumi', 'Iwao, Junko', 'Yonaga, Tsubasa', 'Konno, Hiromi']	[['Oizaki, Fumitoshi', 'Director, Assistant Animation Director'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Suzuki, Kaoru', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Assistant Director'], ['Andou, Takashi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
