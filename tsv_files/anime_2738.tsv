Young Black Jack	TV	12	10/02/2015	10/02/2015	76490	7.23	30729	2740	1938	In the 1960s, a gifted young medical student tries to make a name for himself. Kuroo Hazama is a reserved young man with unusual black-and-white hair, a body covered with scars, and a dark past. Despite only being a medical student, his surgical brilliance starts to attract attention after he completes a seemingly impossible operation. Together with the spirited and honest intern Maiko Okamoto and Yabu, a close friend with a troubled life, Hazama devotes himself to the world of medicine. However, his path to becoming a respectable surgeon is a difficult one as student riots, war, and corruption are consuming Japan. Hazama quickly finds himself caught up in a series of nefarious circumstances that challenge his integrity as a person and his path towards becoming a surgeon. Young Black Jack chronicles the story of a man capable of performing unthinkable feats of medicine, and the journey that leads him to become the legend known as Black Jack.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Young Black Jack', 'Sequel: Black Jack']	['Hazama, Kuroo', 'Okamoto, Maiko', 'Yabu', 'Doctor Kiriko', 'Hige Oyaji', 'Hyakki, Maruo', 'Octane', 'Hugo', 'Lisenberg', 'Tawashi']	['Umehara, Yuuichirou', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Yusa, Kouji', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Tomita, Kousei', 'Miyano, Mamoru', 'Oosaka, Ryouta', 'Takeuchi, Shunsuke', 'Yamanoi, Jin', 'Shioya, Yoku']	[['Kase, Mitsuko', 'Director'], ['Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Sound Director'], ['Takahashi, Ryousuke', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Takuto', 'Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Composition']]
