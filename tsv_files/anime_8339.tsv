She's on a journey to find the woman Jin Valel, who killed her master Hon without feelingâ€”not unlike how Alka has learned to kill in her work as an assassin. On her journey, Alka encounters three strange women, each a great warrior in her own right and grapples with her slain master's wish that she leaves the life of an assassin behind.(Source: ANN)	['Side story: Blade & Soul Specials']	['Alka', 'El, Karen', 'Jin, Varel', 'Jin, Hazuki', 'Dan, Roana', 'Ran, Yu', 'Yuu', 'Masa', 'Shou', 'Koga']	['Takao, Yuki', 'Ohara, Sayaka', 'Yuuki, Aoi', 'Amamiya, Sora', 'Takagaki, Ayahi', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Inoue, Marina', 'Shimozaki, Hiroshi', 'Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Fujiwara, Keiji']	[['Hamasaki, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Takeuchi, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Morishita, Hiroto', 'Sound Director'], ['Yamauchi, Shigeyasu', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
