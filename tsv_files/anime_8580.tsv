Midori-ko	Movie	1	09/24/2011	-	3245	6.01	684	8583	8227	One of the must-see gems making its premiere at our festival, Midori-Ko is adored Japanese animator Kurosaka Keita's whimsically nightmarish vision of 21st-century Tokyo on the brink of apocalypse. Ten years in the making and entirely, single-handedly rendered in colored pencil, Kurosaka's fantastical labor of love is a marvel to behold. Emerging from the staggering detail and craft flooding every frame is the story of a young woman who sets out to engineer a dream-food that can put an end to the world's famine. Synthesizing Frederic Back's subtle, haptic textures with Bill Plympton's frenetic mutations and David Lynch's haunting wormholes, Kurosakaâ€™s work still retains its own singular, luminous potency.(Source: Los Angeles Animation Festival summary)	 	['Fabre-kun', 'Boss', 'Yamamoto']	[]	[['Kurosaka, Keita', 'Director']]
