However, the discovery of MISO — the Material of an Impediment to the Sorcerer's Orders — made magic into not a special power, but a technique that can be raised.

Majieeru happens to be the birthplace of magic.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Mahou Tsukai Nara Miso wo Kue!']	['Benchétrit, Manuela', 'de Mazière, Celestine Edith', 'de Mazière, Artemisia Genevieve', 'Hacchouya, Shouta', 'Narrator', 'Morooka, Buichi', 'Tanaka, Reira']	['Hirohashi, Ryou', 'Nakahara, Mai', 'Hidaka, Rina', 'Suzuki, Tatsuhisa', 'Tachiki, Fumihiko']	[['Bessho, Makoto', 'Director'], ['kz', 'Theme Song Composition, Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Arrangement, Music'], ['Yun*chi', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Ooshima, Miwa', 'Character Design']]
