Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi	TV	12	07/01/2010	07/01/2010	251713	7.2	117145	2893	703	Tomboy Ryouko Ookami is a fierce boxer and the assigned bruiser of her club. Of course, no normal high school club needs a bruiser, but the Otogi Bank operates more akin to an actual bank. Here, the students can ask for favors from the club as long as they promise to return the favor in the future. Sixteen-year-old Ryoushi Morino is a shy boy, a far cry from the Otogi Bank members. To his biggest surprise, after unsuccessfully confessing to Ryouko, he inadvertently finds himself joining the club! Ookami-san to Shichinin no Nakama-tachi follows the everyday lives of the Otogi Bank members as they tackle favors that range from the mundane to the dangerous. However, since Ryoushi's sole motivation is to win Ryouko over, she doubts he will be able to have her back in a fight, especially when he can't even stand having people look at himâ€”much less fight anyone![Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Ookami-san Series']	['Ookami, Ryouko', 'Morino, Ryoushi', 'Akai, Ringo', 'Ryuuguu, Otohime', 'le Fay, Majolica', 'Narrator', 'Nekomiya, Saburou', 'Urashima, Tarou', 'Kiriki, Liszt', 'Kiriki, Alice']	['Itou, Shizuka', 'Irino, Miyu', 'Itou, Kanae', 'Toyosaki, Aki', 'Koyama, Kimiko', 'Arai, Satomi', 'Kaji, Yuki', 'Asanuma, Shintaro', 'Nojima, Hirofumi', 'Horie, Yui']	[['Iwasaki, Yoshiaki', 'Director'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Suzuki, Youhei', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Kawamura, Tomoyuki', 'Episode Director']]
