He frowns when he reads a letter, which is also in the parcel. It says, ""If you write a girl's name in the notebook, you'll be able to control her as you like."" He thinks it is ridiculous at first, but he decides to give it a try. The name he writes is Yumi, his student.... As a result, it comes true, and he shags with her. ""This notebook is proved to be real. I can now have fun with it....""Based on a h-game created by Undermoon studio."
