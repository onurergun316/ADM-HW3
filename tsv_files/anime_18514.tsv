Izumo (2003)	OVA	5	01/25/2003	01/25/2003	2788	6.01	630		8565	My name is Toma Hikaru. I'm going to Izumo Gakuen High School with Miyuki who is my little sister-in-law, Nanami-chan who was my childhood friend, and Nagisa who thinks of me as a rival. I began to have a strange dream of a beautiful shrine maiden, who is praying something naked in a lake. I wonder who she is; I think I know her... I also see a strange room of Izumo Gakuen in my dream. Feeling uneasy, I decide to sneak into the room, not knowing it is the beginning of the long journey.(Source: AnimeNfo)	['Sequel: Izumo: Takeki Tsurugi no Senki']	['Minase, Nanami', 'Touma, Miyuki', 'Kurashima, Nagisa', 'Tachibana, Ayaka', 'Amaterasu', 'Tohma, Hikaru', 'Touka', 'Suzaku', 'Susanoo', 'Byakko']	['Sato, Mikako']	[['Yoshiten', 'Character Design']]
