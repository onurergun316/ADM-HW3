Popolocrois Monogatari Pilot	Special	1	03/23/2000	-	188		0	12825	16274	A pilot for a proposed Popolocrois Monogatari animation project in 1993. It was publicly released 7 years later on the first DVD volume of Popolocrois Monogatari. The pilot's main purpose was to find funding for a theatrical film that was quickly morphed into a possible TV anime instead (which finally happened half a decade later).
