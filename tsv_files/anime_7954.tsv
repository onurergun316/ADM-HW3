Masou Gakuen HxH	TV	12	07/06/2016	07/06/2016	238375	6.15	102114	7957	757	Hida Kizuna possesses the HHG (Heart Hybrid Gear) ability, but it is not strong enough to make him particularly important. His older sister calls him to transfer to a strategic defense school, where many of the students (many of which are large-breasted girls) use their HHG abilities to fight invaders from another world while wearing extremely skimpy pilot outfits. Kizuna's fighting ability doesn't measure up, but his sister has another planâ€”apparently having erotic experiences with Kizuna will allow the girls to replenish their energy or power-up. It looks like his new school life is going to be full of embarrassment.(Source: MangaHelpers)	['Adaptation: Masou Gakuen HxH', 'Other: Masou Gakuen HxH Specials']	['Chidorigafuchi, Aine', 'Himekawa, Hayuru', 'Farandole, Yurishia', 'Hida, Kizuna', 'Hida, Reiri', 'Silkcut, Sylvia', 'Fairchild, Scarlett', 'Gravel', 'Hida, Nayuta', 'Baird, Gertrude']	['Kageyama, Akari', 'Nagatsuma, Juri', 'Akasaki, Chinatsu', 'Akabane, Kenji', 'Kinugawa, Rika', 'Kino, Hina', 'Ishigami, Shizuka', 'Ookubo, Rumi', 'Satosaki, Mei', 'Yamada, Yuki']	[['Furukawa, Hiroyuki', 'Director'], ['Oomuro, Masakatsu', 'Sound Director'], ['Arai, Kazuto', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Yamada, Yasunori', 'Script, Series Composition']]
