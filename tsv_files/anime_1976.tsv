The stakes have never been higher, and the judges are rigorous when it comes to selecting the winner out of the plethora of talented pianists. This competition is so harsh that even famous prodigies can be easily eliminated. Some play for the money, some play to fulfill their duty to their families, and yet others play for their music to be heard. However, the only one who can reach the top is the one who embodies the spirit of the music Frédéric Chopin crafted for future generations. With the stakes higher than ever before, rivalries, friendships, and family ties will be tested, and each pianist will find their own sound.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Piano no Mori', 'Alternative version: Piano no Mori', 'Prequel: Piano no Mori (TV)']	['Ichinose, Kai', 'Amamiya, Shuuhei', 'Ajino, Sousuke', 'Ichinose, Reiko', 'Maruyama, Takako', 'Pang, Wei', 'Szymanowski, Lech', 'Adamski, Karol', 'Amamiya, Namie', 'Saga, Takeshi']	['Saitou, Souma', 'Hanae, Natsuki', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Yuuki, Aoi', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'KENN', 'Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Miyake, Marie', 'Yusa, Kouji']	[['Yamaga, Hiroyuki', 'Director'], ['Suzuki, Ryuutarou', 'Director'], ['Murakawa, Rie', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Isshiki, Makoto', 'Original Creator']]
