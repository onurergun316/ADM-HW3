Memory	Movie	1	09/21/1964	-	2697	6.06	1525	8390	8667	This is a short, privately produced animated film. While elucidating the mystery and fuzziness as well as merits and demerits of memory in idealizing reality, the story develops into a tale of destruction of human beings, turning the existence of the earth into a memory of the universe. The production, only 5 minutes long, greatly helps expand the viewer's imagination, embodying the enchantment of animation.(Source: AniDB)	 	[]	[]
