InuYasha	TV	167	10/16/2000	10/16/2000	669756	7.85	296344	771	207	Based on the Shogakukan award-winning manga of the same name, InuYasha follows Kagome Higurashi, a fifteen-year-old girl whose normal life ends when a demon drags her into a cursed well on the grounds of her family's Shinto shrine. Instead of hitting the bottom of the well, Kagome ends up 500 years in the past during Japan's violent Sengoku period with the demon's true target, a wish-granting jewel called the Shikon Jewel, reborn inside of her.After a battle with a revived demon accidentally causes the sacred jewel to shatter, Kagome enlists the help of a young hybrid dog-demon/human named Inuyasha to help her collect the shards and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Joining Kagome and Inuyasha on their quest are the orphan fox-demon Shippo, the intelligent monk Miroku, and the lethal demon slayer Sango. Together, they must set aside their differences and work together to find the power granting shards spread across feudal Japan and deal with the threats that arise.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: InuYasha', 'Side story: InuYasha Movie 4: Guren no Houraijima', 'Sequel: InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen', 'Other: Shounen Sunday CM Gekijou: InuYasha-hen']	['Inuyasha', 'Higurashi, Kagome', 'Sango', 'Miroku', 'Shippou', 'Sesshoumaru', 'Kikyou', 'Kouga', 'Kagura', 'Naraku']	['Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Yukino, Satsuki', 'Kuwashima, Houko', 'Takagi, Motoki', 'Watanabe, Kumiko', 'Narita, Ken', 'Hidaka, Noriko', 'Matsuno, Taiki', 'Oogami, Izumi', 'Morikawa, Toshiyuki']	[['Suwa, Michihiko', 'Producer, Planning'], ['Ikeda, Masashi', 'Director, Script'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Ishihara, Tatsuya', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
