Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara	TV	13	10/04/2017	10/04/2017	171384	6.96	80017	3949	1030	Chisato Mizusawa is a calm and collected assistant office manager who apparently dislikes drinking alcohol. But she actually likes it and has a secret side to her that emerges only when drunk: her cute persona, which she only reveals to her husband, the bartender Sora. Each day when Chisato comes home, Sora takes care of his beloved wife, providing her with a good meal and a fresh drink. These drinks include Plum Splet, Irish Coffee, Orange Breeze, and many more tasty concoctions that she eagerly gulps down. But as much as she likes alcohol, she loves her kindhearted husband more. Together, they share a life that is filled with happinessâ€”and the more-than-occasional cocktail.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara', 'Sequel: Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara: Yuzu Atsukan']	['Mizusawa, Chisato', 'Mizusawa, Sora', 'Koharu, Sakurai', 'Shiraishi, Masaki', 'Shiraishi, Yui', 'Manager']	['Kitamura, Eri', 'Ichiki, Mitsuhiro', 'Nakada, Arisa', 'Akabane, Kenji', 'Asai, Ayaka', 'Ishizuka, Unshou']	[['Hirasawa, Hisayoshi', 'Director, Sound Director'], ['Tachibana, Saori', 'Director'], ['WORDS in STEREO', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Cellchrome', 'Theme Song Performance']]
