Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei	TV	11	04/23/2010	04/23/2010	364188	8.59	114730	75	457	One autumn evening at a mysterious ramen stand behind the Shimogamo Shrine, a lonely third-year college student bumps into a man with an eggplant-shaped head who calls himself a god of matrimony. Meeting this man causes the student to reflect upon his past two years at collegeâ€”two years bitterly spent trying to break up couples on campus with his only friend Ozu, a ghoulish-looking man seemingly set on making his life as miserable as possible. Resolving to make the most out of the rest of his college life, the student attempts to ask out the unsociable but kind-hearted underclassman Akashi, yet fails to follow through, prompting him to regret not living out his college life differently. As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he is hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance to live his life.Surreal, artistic, and mind-bending, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei chronicles the misadventures of a young man on a journey to make friends, find love, and experience the rose-colored campus life he always dreamed of.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei', 'Side story: Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei Specials', 'Character: Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome', 'Sequel: Yojouhan Time Machine Blues']	['Watashi', 'Akashi', 'Ozu', 'Higuchi, Seitarou', 'Johnny', 'Hanuki, Ryouko', 'Jougasaki, Masaki', 'Kaori', 'Fortune Teller', 'Aijima']	['Asanuma, Shintaro', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Kaida, Yuuko', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Asanuma, Shintaro', 'Mayama, Ako', 'Satou, Setsuji']	[['Yuasa, Masaaki', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Kimura, Eriko', 'Sound Director'], ['Natsume, Shingo', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Choi, Eun-Young', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation']]
