Nagoya Tetsudou Special Movie	ONA	1	07/21/2016	-	243		0	12247	15390	"A short commissioned by Nagoya Railroad Co., Ltd. (abbr. Meitetsu) as part of their ""Place important feelings on places where important people wait."" campaign. In the short we see a woman and her fianc√© on a Nagoya Railroad train to go meet her parents. The woman laments over her youth from having fun as a child with her father on the train, to coldly ignoring him and being mean as a teenager when he comes to pick her up from the station with a spare umbrella on a rainy day. Time healed all wounds and the short ends with the both of them smiling cheerfully as they treasure each other."
