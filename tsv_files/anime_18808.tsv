Surprisingly, a young conductor named Tonoin Kei (known as a musical genius) joins this small orchestra to conduct. Even though Tonoin is a strict conductor, all the members adore him for the notable improvements in their performances and soon Yuuki feels his efforts for the orchestra have been fruitless. Yuuki soon comes to the conclusion that his crush of 3 years likes Tonoin, and he decides to give up on her and leave the orchestra. Tonoin refuses to let him quit, confessing that he loves Yuuki, which reveals that he's gay. Tonoin's love confession confuses Yuuki and it leads to a very horrible misunderstanding.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Fujimi 2-choume Koukyougakudan: Kanrei Zensen Conductor']	['Morimura, Yuuki', 'Tonoin, Kei', 'Kawashima, Natsuko', 'Igarashi, Taketo']	['Okiayu, Ryoutarou', 'Masutani, Yasunori', 'Katsuki, Masako', 'Ishida, Akira']	[['Tamura, Kazuhiko', 'Assistant Animation Director'], ['Seki, Kazuhiko', 'Editing'], ['Akizuki, Koh', 'Original Creator']]
