"Dragon Ball Z Movie 15: Fukkatsu no ""F"""	Movie	1	04/18/2015	-	142257	7.07	95788	3481	1240	Earth is finally peaceful again, but this calm is short-lived. The remnants of Frieza's army, led by Sorbet and his right hand Tagoma, arrive on Earth in order to summon Shen Long with the goal of resurrecting their old master. To do so, they threaten Emperor Pilaf, Shuu, and Mai for the Dragon Balls in their possession.Once successfully revived, Frieza—who had been stoking his hatred for Gokuu Son and Future Trunks in Hell—proclaims that he will not be content until they are dead by his hand. Sorbet informs him that Future Trunks has not been heard of in years, and Gokuu's power has far surpassed even that of the mighty Majin Buu. Unfazed, Frieza responds that he only requires a few months of training before being capable of defeating Gokuu.Will Frieza be able to exact revenge upon his nemesis, or will Gokuu, Vegeta, and their friends prevail against adversity, saving Earth once more?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	"['Adaptation: Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no ""F""', 'Parent story: Dragon Ball Z', 'Prequel: Dragon Ball Z Movie 14: Kami to Kami', 'Alternative version: Dragon Ball Super']"	['Son, Gokuu', 'Vegeta', 'Freeza', 'Son, Gohan', 'Piccolo', 'Future Trunks', 'Bulma', 'Muten-Roushi', 'Kuririn', 'Jinzouningen 18-gou']	['Nozawa, Masako', 'Horikawa, Ryo', 'Nakao, Ryusei', 'Nozawa, Masako', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Kusao, Takeshi', 'Tsuru, Hiromi', 'Satou, Masaharu', 'Tanaka, Mayumi', 'Itou, Miki']	[['Sabat, Christopher', 'Producer, ADR Director'], ['Yamamuro, Tadayoshi', 'Director'], ['Momoiro Clover Z', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Toriyama, Akira', 'Screenplay, Original Character Design, Original Creator']]
