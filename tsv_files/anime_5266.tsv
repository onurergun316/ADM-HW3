Long Riders!	TV	12	10/08/2016	10/08/2016	24573	6.67	8022	5269	3635	"Falling in love at first sight with a collapsible bicycle outside the station, Ami Kurata, first-year university student empties her account without a second thought and buys the bicycle. Now she enjoys weekend cycling trips with Aoi, her childhood friend, and Hinako, a senior at her university. ""Owning a road bike may change your view of the world completely."" Prompted by the comment, Ami purchased a road bike, and she is really impressed with the traveling performance. As soon as she places her feet on the pedals and presses down, everything about riding a road bicycle—the lightness of the pedal, the speed, the acceleration—is nothing like she has ever experienced. Ami's cycle life gets going with the new road cycle as her partner!(Source: Showgate, edited)"	['Adaptation: Long Riders!', 'Summary: Long Riders!
