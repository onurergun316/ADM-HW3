Yami Shibai 4	TV	13	01/16/2017	01/16/2017	24516	5.75	12339	9557	3651	Excited children gather around the enigmatic masked Storyteller once more. His unique kamishibai storytelling draws them into tales of fear and dread. These are dark and foreboding stories, which could happen to anyone...This season has tales of a salaryman who buries a dead cat, only to be haunted soon after; a college student and her cheap new apartment that hides a ghastly secret; boys exploring an abandoned haunted house before coming across a strange fish tank; a man who finds himself on the wrong bus, and in more danger than he thought possible; and a young couple's visit to an amusement park, which suddenly takes a dark turn. All these stories and more await in Yami Shibai 4.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Prequel: Yami Shibai 3', 'Sequel: Yami Shibai 5']	['Storyteller']	[]	[['Hosoya, Nobuyuki', 'Producer'], ['Hirose, Motoki', 'Producer'], ['Kumamoto, Hiromu', 'Script'], ['Takuto', 'Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Composition']]
