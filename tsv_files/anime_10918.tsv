But to secure the integrity of these life-threatening gambles, a violent and powerful organization by the name of ""Kagerou"" referees these games as a neutral party. Follow Bak Madarame a.k.a. Usogui (The Lie Eater) as he gambles against maniacal opponents at games—such as Escape the Abandoned Building, Old Maid, and Hangman—to ultimately ""out-gamble"" and control the neutral organization of Kagerou itself.
