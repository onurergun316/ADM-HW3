Youjuu Toshi	Movie	1	04/25/1987	-	39426	6.45	15858	6398	2838	There is Earth, our familiar world, and then there is the Black World, a parallel dimension that very few people are aware of. For centuries, a pact between the two worlds has been observed to maintain peace, and terms must be negotiated and renewed soon to continue relative harmony.This time around, there is a militant faction that will stop at nothing to prevent the signing of a new treaty for inter-dimensional peace. Two agents of the elite organization known as the Black guards—defenders of the balance between the two worlds—are charged with ensuring the success of the treaty.Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) blends stylish eroticism, graphic horror and pulse-pounding action as these two race to consummate the peace treaty in time.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Wicked City']	['Makie', 'Renzaburo, Taki', 'Spider Woman', 'Co-Worker (Female)', 'Co-Worker (Male)', 'Soap Girl', 'Hotel Owner', 'Jin', 'Mayart, Giuseppe', 'Company President']	['Fujita, Toshiko', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Yokoo, Mari', 'Andou, Arisa', 'Ooki, Tamio', 'Totani, Kouji', 'Nagai, Ichiro', 'Muramatsu, Yasuo']	[['Kawajiri, Yoshiaki', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Hamasaki, Hiroshi', 'Key Animation'], ['Koike, Takeshi', 'Key Animation'], ['Okamura, Tensai', 'Key Animation']]
