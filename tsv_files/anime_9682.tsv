Nar Doma	TV	26	05/17/2015	05/17/2015	2535	5.72	118	9685	8836	"The ""unorthodox hard surreal gag"" comedy centers around the narcissistic (narushi na) Hagito and the masochistic (domazo na) Kei. Together they are ""Nar Doma.""Hagito is a handsome yet pitiful man with a loli complex. Anytime, anywhere, a mirror is his constant companion. Surrounding him are a host of highly idiosyncratic characters: the diehard masochist Kei, the unnaturally strong yet girlish Totono, the exceedingly stylish working stiff Saitou, and the extraordinarily negative Roku. Even the one normal guy has his own issues.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Nar Doma', 'Side story: Nar Doma Special']	['Monoi, Shuuhei', 'Hamago, Keisuke', 'Umihara, Hagito', 'Aozane, Rokuta', 'Hanashiro, Totono', 'Saitou, Yuu']	['Adachi, Yuuto', 'Miyazaki, Atsumi', 'Max', 'Oda, Toshimitsu', 'Kahara, Yuu', 'Hirayama, Emi']	[['Onaka, Takeshi', 'Director'], ['Furuya, Yuuji', 'Sound Effects'], ['Kome to Kaite Meter', 'Original Creator']]
