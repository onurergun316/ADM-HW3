Rudolf to Ippaiattena	Movie	1	08/06/2016	-	1070	6.63	266	5425	10983	Rudolf enjoys a life of comfort and care in Gifu, Japan. Yet true to the adage, curiosity gets the best of the kitten, and he decides to explore beyond the four walls of his home. When he's inadvertently whisked into the back of a cargo truck and lands in Tokyo, he befriends Ippaiattena, a seasoned street cat who possesses a crucial and unusual skill that will help him find his way home: the ability to read the human language. Rudolf's journey is rich with Japanese culture, and his story celebrates the wonder of discoveryâ€”that magical moment when you realize you have the key to unlock the world.(Source: New York International Children's Film Festival)	['Other: Rudolf to Ippaiattena x Godzilla x Toho Cinemas Moving Logo Eizou']	['Ippaiattena', 'Rudolf', 'Devil', 'Butchy']	['Suzuki, Ryouhei', 'Inoue, Mao', 'Furuta, Arata', 'Yashima, Norito']	[['Yuyama, Kunihiko', 'Director'], ['Sakakibara, Motonori', 'Director'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Katou, Youichi', 'Script']]
