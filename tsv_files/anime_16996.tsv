Lalala Lala-chan ★Uchuu ni Muchuu★	TV	12	10/06/2017	10/06/2017	210		0	17002	15857	"An alien named Luckle from the planet Lucky Star crashes their spaceship in Mori Town. He has the ability to give ""lucky"" or ""unlucky"" outcomes to people via telekinesis. Lala-chan helps him get to safety but in doing so, the town (and her friends) thinks she's harboring a dangerous being using it to do crimes no thanks to Salmiakki. Unfortunately a darker power lurks to bring wickedness upon Mori Town by corrupting Salmiakki even further."
