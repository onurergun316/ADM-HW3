Barbapapa	TV	45	10/13/1974	10/13/1974	2384	6.21	1045	7643	8967	Barbapapa and his family can turn into anything they want. Each member of the family has his or her own personality. Very good show for the youngest children as each episode deals with another problem they will recognize in a way that is 'morally correct'.(Source: ANN)	['Alternative setting: Barbapapa Sekai wo Mawaru', 'Character: Barbapapa Sekai wo Mawaru', 'Sequel: Barbapapa (1977)']	['Barbapapa', 'Barbabelle', 'Barbamama', 'Narrator', 'Barbazoo']	['Chafurin', 'Han, Keiko', 'Matsuoka, Youko']	[['Yamada, Katsuhisa', 'Episode Director'], ['Yuyama, Kunihiko', 'Storyboard'], ['Schubert, Franz Peter', 'Theme Song Composition'], ['Pierpont, James Lord', 'Theme Song Composition']]
