Alongside Mutsuko Sakura, his classmate from elementary school, he aims to lead the team to glory. However, due to unexpected circumstances, Fuurin's baseball team is left with only six members: Daigo, Mutsuko, Yayoi Sawa, Tao Sagara, Seira Kandori, and Hiromu Tanba. Left with mostly female players and lacking in experience, the team struggles to gain confidence and trust from the new recruitsâ€”Akira Nishina, Anita Kabashima, and Chisato Fujii. Facing challenges such as having no proper coach, problematic recruits, and a limited number of members, Daigo's resolution is put to the test as he tries to bring the team together in time to participate in their first ever tournament.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Major 2nd', 'Prequel: Major 2nd (TV)']	['Shigeno, Daigo', 'Sakura, Mutsuko', 'Nishina, Akira', 'Honda, Gorou', 'Satou, Toshiya', 'Shimizu, Kaoru', 'Fujii, Chisato', 'Sawa, Yayoi', 'Satou, Hikaru', 'Sagara, Tao']	['Fujiwara, Natsumi', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Yamashita, Daiki', 'Uesaka, Sumire', 'Kawase, Maki', 'Sakura, Ayane']	[['Watanabe, Ayumu', 'Director'], ['Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Sound Director'], ['Yamai, Sayaka', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Konuta, Kenji', 'Script']]
