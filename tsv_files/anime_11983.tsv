Forest Fairy Five	TV	13	01/06/2017	01/06/2017	2977	3.3	671	11989	8416	A beautiful nation, prospering since ancient times, Japan is now known as the Anime Kingdom. There are more than just humans living there; animes truly do exist in Japan. Past the Fairy Ring, to the world of fairies, live anime-chans. There's a Fairy Ring in your town, too. Here. And there. Even in Harajuku. Maybe even in the Ashigara mountains. By some chance, we'll open that door. And we might get to meet the anime-chans. This is the land where you get to meet anime-chans.(Source: Crunchyroll)	['Other: Mori no Yousei: Kinoko no Musume', 'Sequel: Yousei Land Mukashibanashi']	['Kamuriya, Paludosa', 'Amanita, Muscaria', 'Amanita, Virosa', 'Yamadori, Porcini B', 'Mizunara, Mai']	['Nakano, Aimi']	NA
