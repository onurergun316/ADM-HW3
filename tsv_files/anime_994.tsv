Calling himself Doraemon, this robot tells Nobita that his future descendants from the 22nd century live in poverty because of all the mistakes he made. Therefore, they have sent Doraemon to serve as a guide and mentor to Nobita, so that their future may change for the better. What Doraemon comes to learn, though, is that Nobita is the weakest and laziest student in the whole school.To assist in his quest, Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket with him, in which he keeps various machines and gadgets from the future. Unfortunately, these often result in even more trouble for Nobita. Will Doraemon really be able to achieve his mission of changing Nobita, or will he remain as he is?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Doraemon', 'Prequel: Doraemon', 'Side story: Doraemon Movie 26: Nobita no Kyouryuu 2006', 'Sequel: Doraemon (2005)', 'Other: Doraemon Eigo Kyoushitsu', 'Alternative version: Doraemon: Benkyou Heya no Tsuribori']	['Doraemon', 'Nobi, Nobita', 'Minamoto, Shizuka', 'Honekawa, Suneo', 'Gouda, Takeshi', 'Dorami', 'Dekisugi, Hidetoshi', 'Nobi, Nobisuke', 'Nobi, Tamako', 'Gouda, Jaiko']	['Ooyama, Nobuyo', 'Ohara, Noriko', 'Nomura, Michiko', 'Kimotsuki, Kaneta', 'Tatekabe, Kazuya', 'Yokozawa, Keiko', 'Shirakawa, Sumiko', 'Naka, Yousuke', 'Chijimatsu, Sachiko', 'Aoki, Kazuyo']	[['Shibayama, Tsutomu', 'Director'], ['Moriwaki, Makoto', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Tsuji, Masaki', 'Script'], ['Ishihara, Tatsuya', 'Storyboard']]
