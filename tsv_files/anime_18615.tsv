She married Genyo, and they started a normal, happy suburban life together. Of course, Anastasia sometimes can't resist using her magic to help her get through the trials and tribulations of everyday life, and her powerful mother is still a bad witch. But what this really means for Anastasia is that she needs to channel her sperm-powered sex magic to fight off her psychotic lesbian mother and her army of crazed sex slaves and demons!
