With their relationship no longer defined as the mighty Void mage and clueless familiar, she wonders what exactly this means for them.While venturing to a castle, Louise is ambushed by a powerful mage named Sheffield. Battling alone, the young mage nearly faces defeat until Saito makes his appearance. The mystical and unknown nature of Void magic seems to be at work in the battle, and Louise begins to believe in the possibility of another Void user. Moreover, she realizes that Saito's magical rune is fading, and so a new adventure begins as they search for the elf who revived Saito in the past. The relationship between former master and servant faces a new challenge as they work to restore the runes and redefine the bond which holds them together.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Zero no Tsukaima', 'Prequel: Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi', 'Side story: Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo - Yuuwaku no Sunahama', 'Spin-off: Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama', 'Sequel: Zero no Tsukaima F']	"['Le Blanc de La Vallière, Louise Françoise', 'Hiraga, Saito', ""d'Orléans, Charlotte Hélène"", 'Derflinger', 'de Tristain, Henrietta', 'Siesta', 'Westwood, Tiffania', 'von Anhalt-Zerbst, Kirche Augusta Frederica', 'de Gramont, Guiche', 'Chesare, Julio']"	['Kugimiya, Rie', 'Hino, Satoshi', 'Inokuchi, Yuka', 'Gotou, Tetsuo', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Horie, Yui', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Inoue, Nanako', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Hirakawa, Daisuke']	[['Kou, Yuu', 'Director'], ['Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Suzuki, Youhei', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Nakase, Rika', 'Script']]
