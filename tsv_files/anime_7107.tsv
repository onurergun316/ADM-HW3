However, the surgeon that rescues him is far from just an ordinary doctor—he commands a strike team known as Black Label whose task is to exterminate deadly criminals who have fallen too far. Filled with a new determination, Arashi joins the ranks of the vigilante organization.Black Label's targets are aplenty, as evil scum lurks everywhere—dangerous arms dealers, corrupt politicians, and shady gangsters all find themselves hunted by the extermination team. Although haunted by their dark and sinister past, all of the hunters are highly skilled at slaying their targets. In spite of the perilous lives the members live, Arashi and the gorgeous ladies surrounding him still manage to get caught up in a variety of sultry moments and racy hijinks. Though they face strong opposition, nothing can stop Black Label's objective of cleansing the world of ghastly evil.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Triage X', 'Sequel: Triage X: Recollection XOXO']	['Hitsugi, Sayo', 'Kiba, Mikoto', 'Mikami, Arashi', 'Sagiri, Yuuko', 'Nashida, Oriha', 'Tsurugi, Miki', 'Hizaki, Chikage', 'Komine, Youko', 'Winchester, Fiona Ran', 'Goryuu']	['Shiraishi, Ryouko', 'Kondou, Yui', 'Akabane, Kenji', 'Ono, Fuyuka', 'Satou, Amina', 'Asano, Masumi', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka', 'Ichimichi, Mao', 'Hisakawa, Aya', 'Kokuryu, Sachi']	[['Takami, Akio', 'Director, Storyboard, Chief Animation Director, Key Animation, Character Design'], ['Kato, Takao', 'Director'], ['Hamano, Takatoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Takahashi, Hideya', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
