Urikupen Kyuujo-tai	TV	156	09/30/1974	09/30/1974	373		0	14073	13761	Four young animals, rabbit Seitaro Usagi, squirrel Risu, bear Kuma, and penguin Penguin (U-Ri-Ku-Pen), are part of a team of brave young animals that rescues others in peril. Other team members included a dog, a boar, a deer, a koala, a mouse, a seagull, and a lion. The animals would win a prize for completing a mission, as would the viewers, who were encouraged to write in and guess which of the creatures would save the world by each Friday (a single mission stretched over a week of TV). Created by Mitsuru Kaneko, this show was given a limited broadcast on some American local TV stations for the Japanese community.(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)	 	['Penguin, Pete', 'Dear, Donny', 'Hog, Harry', 'Bear, Barney', 'Rabbit, Seitarou', 'Squirrel, Scooter', 'Narrator', 'Pigeon, Petula']	['Mizutori, Tetsuo', 'Kita, Michie', 'Naya, Rokurou', 'Ichiryuusai, Harumi']	[['Sasagawa, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Toriumi, Jinzou', 'Script'], ['Mizuki, Ichirou', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Kikuchi, Shunsuke', 'Theme Song Composition, Theme Song Arrangement, Music']]
