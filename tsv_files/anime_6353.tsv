Mitsubachi Maya no Bouken	TV	52	04/01/1975	04/01/1975	8070	6.46	4414	6355	5786	Maya, a newborn honeybee, brims with curiosity about the world around her. From the time she is born, she is brought up to be a worker bee, but it is difficult for her to understand and follow the strict rules of the hive because of her individuality and strong desire for independence.Having collected all the honey around the honeycomb, Maya decides to set out on an adventure to find a flower garden in order to collect more honey for the hive. Her intentions are noble, but because she leaves the hive without permission, the Queen sends Maya's friend Willy to search for the little troublemaker. Willy joins Maya in her quest, and together, beyond the familiar hive, the two friends marvel at the sheer beauty that nature has to offer.Through many experiences—sometimes enjoyable, sometimes terrible or sad—and encounters with various insects, Maya matures into a strong and wise honeybee.(Source: Nipponanimation)	['Sequel: Shin Mitsubachi Maya no Bouken']	['Maya', 'Willi', 'Phillip']	['Nomura, Michiko', 'Nozawa, Masako', 'Nagai, Ichiro']	[['Saitou, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Svoboda, Karel', 'Music'], ['Mori, Yasuji', 'Layout'], ['Ioka, Masahiro', 'Art Director']]
