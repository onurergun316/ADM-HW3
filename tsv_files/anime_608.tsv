Unfortunately, the club has been disbanded and he takes it upon himself to revive it by finding students who are willing to join. Without much luck, Onoda decides to make a round trip to Akihabara on his old, bulky city bicycle, a weekly 90-kilometer ride he has been completing since fourth grade.This is when he meets fellow first year student, Shunsuke Imaizumi, a determined cyclist who is using the school's steep incline for practice. Surprised by Onoda's ability to climb the hill with his specific type of bicycle, Imaizumi challenges him to a race, with the proposition of joining the anime club should Onoda win. And thus begins the young boy's first foray into the world of high school bicycle racing![Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Yowamushi Pedal', 'Side story: Yowamushi Pedal: Special Ride', 'Sequel: Yowamushi Pedal: Grande Road', 'Summary: Yowamushi Pedal: Re:RIDE', 'Spin-off: Yowamushi Pedal: Spare Bike', 'Other: Chiba Pedal: Yowamushi Pedal to Manabu Jitensha Koutsuu Anzen']	['Onoda, Sakamichi', 'Naruko, Shoukichi', 'Imaizumi, Shunsuke', 'Midousuji, Akira', 'Makishima, Yuusuke', 'Arakita, Yasutomo', 'Manami, Sangaku', 'Toudou, Jinpachi', 'Teshima, Junta', 'Shinkai, Hayato']	['Yamashita, Daiki', 'Fukushima, Jun', 'Toriumi, Kousuke', 'Yusa, Kouji', 'Morikubo, Shoutarou', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Yonaga, Tsubasa', 'Kakihara, Tetsuya', 'Kishio, Daisuke', 'Hino, Satoshi']	[['Nabeshima, Osamu', 'Director'], ['Takadera, Takeshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Sunayama, Kurasumi', 'Script'], ['Tanaka, Ryou', 'Storyboard, Key Animation']]
