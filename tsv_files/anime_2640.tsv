Nagasarete Airantou	TV	26	04/05/2007	04/05/2007	91431	7.25	39298	2643	1728	Ikuto Touhohin just had a fight with his old man, one that led him to make a rash decision to run away from home. He boards a ship, deciding to take a vacation, but the ship is suddenly hit by a huge stormâ€”one that sends Ikuto overboard! When he regains consciousness, he realizes he is still alive on some island. An isolated island. An isolated island with nothing but girls. Beautiful girls. Stranded on an island with only girls, no electricity, gas, radio, television, like he was back in the stone age.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Nagasarete Airantou']	['Suzu', 'Touhouin, Ikuto', 'Machi', 'Rin', 'Ayane', 'Tonkatsu', 'Shinobu', 'Mei Mei', 'Karaage', 'Yukino']	['Horie, Yui', 'Shimono, Hiro', 'Takahashi, Mikako', 'Shiraishi, Ryouko', 'Chiba, Saeko', 'Watanabe, Akeno', 'Kimoto, Orie', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Oota, Tetsuharu', 'Hasegawa, Shizuka']	[['Okamoto, Hideki', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Koga, Kazuomi', 'Episode Director'], ['Ishikura, Kenichi', 'Episode Director'], ['Ikeda, Mamiko', 'Script, Series Composition, 2nd Key Animation']]
