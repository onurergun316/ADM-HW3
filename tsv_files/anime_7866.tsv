Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki: Jonan no Saijitsu	Special	1	01/27/2017	-	3286	6.16	670	7869	8162	"An unaired episode 13 of Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki included on the DVD/BD release. Kiitarou runs into typical ecchi manga tropes due to Lucky Eros albeit he doesn't feel ""lucky"" and tries to avoid everything happening between him and the female youkai."
