Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam	TV	50	03/02/1985	03/02/1985	59977	7.9	29366	697	2250	It is Universal Century 0087, and the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon is over. The Earth Federation has created an elite task force, known as the Titans, who are responsible for hunting the remaining Zeon forces. However, the power-hungry Titans have shown themselves to be no better than Zeon, spurring the creation of a rebellious faction called the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG).17-year-old Kamille Bidan lives in the colony Green Noa, home to a Titan base. Kamille gets in trouble after assaulting a Titan officer, an event that coincides with an attack led by former Zeon ace Char Aznable, now known as AEUG pilot Quattro Bajeena. When Kamille steals a Titan's prototype Gundam, he soon finds himself in the middle of the dangerous conflict.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kidou Senshi Z Gundam', 'Prequel: Mobile Suit Gundam', 'Sequel: Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ', 'Alternative version: Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation - Heir to the Stars', 'Side story: Gundam Neo Experience 0087: Green Divers', 'Summary: Akai Shouzou: Char, Soshite Frontal e']	['Aznable, Char', 'Bidan, Kamille', 'Ray, Amuro', 'Karn, Haman', 'Noa, Bright', 'Haro', 'Mass, Sayla', 'Zabi, Mineva Lao', 'Shiden, Kai', 'Noa, Hathaway']	['Ikeda, Shuuichi', 'Tobita, Nobuo', 'Furuya, Toru', 'Sakakibara, Yoshiko', 'Suzuoki, Hirotaka', 'Shou, Mayumi', 'Itou, Miki', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Hanai, Yasuko']	[['Yatate, Hajime', 'Producer, Original Creator'], ['Uchida, Kenji', 'Producer'], ['Tomino, Yoshiyuki', 'Director, Original Creator'], ['Sekita, Osamu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard']]
