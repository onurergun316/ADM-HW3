Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!	TV	12	01/08/2019	01/08/2019	161682	7.32	62196	2331	1102	College student Miyako Hoshino is quite shy around other people. She mostly spends her time in her room making cosplay outfits. When her fifth-grade sister Hinata brings her classmate Hana Shirosaki home, Miyako instantly becomes captivated with Hana's cuteness. Miyako tries to do various things, ranging from making Hana wear cosplay dresses to giving her sweets. This gives Hana a bad impression of her at first, but Miyako will do anything to grow closer to the angel who has descended before her.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!', 'Other: Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!
