However, those days of being bullied by classmates and escaping to a fantasy of being a hero are put to an end when a certain ""accident"" bestows on him a girl and a gigantic humanoid robot called ""LINEBARREL."" The extraordinary power that Kouichi obtains puts him and everything around him on a sudden rollercoaster ride of battles, intrigues and friendship! During the course of his adventure, the boy starts to learn what life has to offer; he meets new friends, bids farewell to the old ones, but most of all he now has considerable responsibilities and is forced to confront the world around him.(Source: Official site)"	['Adaptation: Kurogane no Linebarrel', 'Side story: Kurogane no Linebarrels Specials']	['Hayase, Kouichi', 'Kizaki, Emi', 'Moritsugu, Reiji', 'Kujou, Miu', 'Ishigami, Kunio', 'Yamashita, Satoru', 'Endo, Shizuna', 'Smith, Jack', 'Sugawara, Masaki', 'Brown, Judy']	['Kakihara, Tetsuya', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'Hirano, Aya', 'Nakata, Jouji', 'Sawashiro, Miyuki', 'Ueda, Kana', 'Sato, Biichi', 'Chiba, Susumu', 'Katsuki, Masako']	[['Nagai, Masaru', 'Producer'], ['Hidaka, Masamitsu', 'Director'], ['Shiraishi, Michita', 'Episode Director'], ['Nobuta, Yuu', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
