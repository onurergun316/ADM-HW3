Tenshi na Konamaiki	TV	50	04/06/2002	04/06/2002	24410	7.46	8273	1769	3640	Megumi-chan is a girl with a secret past. She used to be a boy until she met a person she thought was a magic user. This person gave him/her a magical book from which a genie appears to grant one wish when blood is applied to it. Megumi made the wish to be a man in a man's body but the genie has a twist: he grants wishes backwards so he turns Megumi-kun aged 9 to Megumi-chan. Years pass and Megumi enters High School where she immediately beats up the school bully who of course falls in love with her. She is looking for that book again to be able to reverse the spell placed upon her.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Tenshi na Konamaiki', 'Side story: Tenshi na Konamaiki Specials']	['Amatsuka, Megumi', 'Soga, Genzo', 'Hanakain, Miki', 'Kobayashi, Hitomonji', 'Yasuda, Tasuke', 'Fujiki, Ichiro', 'Koakuma', 'Yoriko', 'Peter', 'Amatsuka, Tsubasa']	['Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Takagi, Wataru', 'Ohmoto, Makiko', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Tanaka, Kazunari', 'Umezu, Hideyuki', 'Nakajima, Chisato', 'Futamata, Issei', 'Urawa, Megumi']	[['Kobayashi, Noriko', 'Producer'], ['Okuwaki, Masaharu', 'Director'], ['Urakami, Yasuo', 'Sound Director'], ['U-ka Saegusa in db', 'Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics']]
