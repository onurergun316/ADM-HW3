Miracle☆Girls	TV	51	01/08/1993	01/08/1993	4125	7.16	1051	3069	7549	Mikage and Tomomi Matsunaga are Miracle Girls: they have a telepathic link with each other and can teleport when they link their little fingers. Tomomi is a sports star and has a boyfriend called Noda. Mikage is the smartest student in the school and is in love with her sempai. He moved to London to study but they still kept in touch, that is until a selfish princess called Marie decides that he should come with her back to Diammas. Back in Japan the twins are having various problems of their own. But they soon realise that there is a link between Marie, an ancient legend, and a girl they know called Emma.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Miracle☆Girls']	['Matsunaga, Tomomi', 'Matsunaga, Mikage', 'Kurashige, Hideaki', 'Noda, Yuuya', 'Kageura, Shinichiro', 'Diamas, Marie Milgraine']	['Fujieda, Nariko', 'Hidaka, Noriko', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Yamaguchi, Ken', 'Yamazaki, Wakana']	[['Annou, Takashi', 'Director'], ['Tokita, Hiroko', 'Director'], ['Kobayashi, Katsuyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Daichi, Akitarou', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
