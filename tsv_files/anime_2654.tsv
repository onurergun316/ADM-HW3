Ajin Part 2: Shoutotsu	Movie	1	05/06/2016	-	23834	7.25	4870	2657	3705	For high schooler Kei—and for at least forty-six others—immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever.Sadly for Kei, such a feat doesn't make him a superhero. In the eyes of both the general public and governments, he's a rare specimen who needs to be hunted down and handed over to scientists to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity.(Source: Vertical)	['Adaptation: Ajin', 'Prequel: Ajin Part 1: Shoudou', 'Sequel: Ajin Part 3: Shougeki', 'Alternative version: Ajin']	['Nagai, Kei', 'Satou', 'Tosaki, Yuu', 'Nakamura, Shinya', 'Kotobuki, Takeshi']	['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Sakurai, Takahiro']	[['Seshita, Hiroyuki', 'Director'], ['Andou, Hiroaki', 'Director'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['ryo-timo', 'Episode Director']]
