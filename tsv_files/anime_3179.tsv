Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to The Animation	TV	12	04/08/2014	04/08/2014	243788	7.14	114344	3181	728	Yuuki Aito is a perverted manga artist who appreciates panties, wishing to draw as many as he can. Being surrounded by numerous female assistants, he is constantly asking to use them as references for the manga he draws.Although Aito has an extremely degenerate mind, he can also be a very kind, generous, and helpful person. The duality of his behavior confuses his assistantsâ€”do they love the considerate side of him that he rarely displays, or do they hate him for the perverted thoughts he has most of the time?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to', 'Side story: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to The Animation Specials']	['Aito, Yuuki', 'Ashisu, Sahoto', 'Kuroi, Sena', 'Otosuna, Mihari', 'Fuwa, Rinna', 'Branya', 'Minano, Matome', 'Ashisu, Sahono', 'Motoki, Tamako', 'Ichika, Konno']	['Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Hayami, Saori', 'Kugimiya, Rie', 'Noto, Arisa', 'Iguchi, Yuka', 'Tanaka, Manami', 'Itou, Miku']	[['Furuta, Jouji', 'Director'], ['Motoyama, Satoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Itami, Aki', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Theme Song Performance']]
