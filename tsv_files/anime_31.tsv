A new semester has begun and with graduation looming over Araragi, he must quickly decide the paths he will walk, as well as the relationships and friends that he'll save. But as strange events begin to unfold, Araragi is nowhere to be found, and a vicious tiger apparition has appeared in his absence. Hanekawa has become its target, and she must fend for herselfâ€”or bow to the creature's perspective on the feebleness of humanity.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Monogatari Series: Second Season', 'Prequel: Nisemonogatari', 'Sequel: Tsukimonogatari', 'Side story: Owarimonogatari']	['Senjougahara, Hitagi', 'Oshino, Shinobu', 'Araragi, Koyomi', 'Kaiki, Deishuu', 'Hanekawa, Tsubasa', 'Hachikuji, Mayoi', 'Sengoku, Nadeko', 'Kanbaru, Suruga', 'Oshino, Ougi', 'Ononoki, Yotsugi']	['Saitou, Chiwa', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Horie, Yui', 'Katou, Emiri', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Sawashiro, Miyuki', 'Mizuhashi, Kaori', 'Hayami, Saori']	[['Iwakami, Atsuhiro', 'Producer'], ['Kubota, Mitsutoshi', 'Producer'], ['Shinbou, Akiyuki', 'Director, Series Composition'], ['Itamura, Tomoyuki', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation']]
