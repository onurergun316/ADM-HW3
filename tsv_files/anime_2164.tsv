Still, since he lives alone, he must carry on to sustain himself. Little do humans like Kuroto know, this stress takes the form of darkness residing within a person's body and will bring one's life to ruin. Fox deities can see this darkness and have the duty to save people before it is too late. To help rid Kuroto of his stress,Senko-san, an eight hundred-year-old foxgirl, volunteers to take care of him, and will do everything she can to ease the tension in his weary soul.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san', 'Other: Super Senko-san Time Episode 12']	['Senko-san', 'Nakano, Kuroto', 'Shiro', 'Sora', 'Kouenji, Yasuko', 'Mitaka']	['Waki, Azumi', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Uchida, Maaya', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Sakura, Ayane', 'Fukushima, Jun']	[['Koshida, Tomoaki', 'Director'], ['Tsuchiya, Masaki', 'Sound Director'], ['Nakamura, Yoshiko', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Uchida, Maaya', 'Theme Song Performance']]
