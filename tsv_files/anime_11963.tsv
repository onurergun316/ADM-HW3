Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun	ONA	2	03/15/2017	03/15/2017	6781	3.69	3817	11969	6212	In an attempt to strengthen relations with foreign nations amongst international unrest, United States president Trap-kun decides to embrace Japan by enrolling at an ordinary high school as its newest transfer student. However, instead of learning about the nationâ€™s rich culture, he uses his power and privilege to educate his new peers about himself. With a tremendous vocabulary, President Trap-kun raps about the struggles of his position and the multipurpose nature of his hair as he makes his way into the hearts of Japanese youth.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Yo!
