There, his sisters-in-law, Shirakaw Kyoko, Ryoko and Anzu, who have grown to be very beautiful women, are waiting for him. The sisters welcome him, and let him use the room of their father who is always absent because of his archaeological studies. In the room, he finds a queer jar. It is a cursed jar that will cast upon him the worst of curses unless he collects women's love juices within a limited period of time.(Source: AnimeNfo)	['Adaptation: Anejiru: Shirakawa Sanshimai ni Omakase', 'Alternative version: Imouto Jiru', 'Sequel: Ane Jiru 2 The Animation: Shirakawa Sanshimai ni Omakase']	['Shirakawa, Ryouko', 'Shirakawa, Kyouko', 'Shirakawa, Anzu', 'Shirakawa, Yuu', 'Kuri']	['Sakurai, Harumi', 'Hyo-sei', 'Sakata, Kayo', 'Rikimaru, Noriko']	[['Atelier Kaguya', 'Original Creator'], ['Choco-Chip', 'Original Character Design'], ['Tayama, Mamito', 'Animation Director']]
