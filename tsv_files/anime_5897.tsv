Africa no Salaryman (TV)	TV	12	10/07/2019	10/07/2019	22148	6.54	6378	5900	3832	Africa no Salaryman is a slapstick workplace comedy that follows the adventures of kind Lion, jaded Lizard, and perverted Toucan, as they trudge through office life while also becoming caught up in antics no regular office worker should. Of course, most of these are the fault of Toucan, whose selfish actions and lack of filter still haven't gotten him fired. It's up to Lizard and Lion to keep themselves out of trouble and hang on to their jobs at the office. But trouble is never too far away from these savannah-treading folk.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Africa no Salaryman', 'Alternative version: Africa no Salaryman']	['Toucan', 'Lizard', 'Lion', 'Deadly Hamster', 'Shishimura', 'President Turtle', 'Caracal', 'Gorimi', 'Jackami']	['Shimono, Hiro', 'Tsuda, Kenjirou', 'Ootsuka, Akio', 'Kino, Hina', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Ogura, Yui', 'Matsui, Eriko']	[['Tatamitani, Tetsuya', 'Director, Color Design, Color Setting, Background Art, Director of Photography, Art Director, Chief Animation Director, Animation Director'], ['Momose, Yuuichirou', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Shimono, Hiro', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Ootsuka, Akio', 'Theme Song Performance']]
