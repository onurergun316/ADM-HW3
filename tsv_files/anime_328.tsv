Mo Dao Zu Shi Q	ONA	30	07/31/2020	07/31/2020	15785	8.19	4486	328	4472	The cultivation classes in the Cloud Recesses have started, and Wei Wuxian is as mischievous as ever. From getting in trouble for cheating to tempting the ever-so-cold and stoic Lan Wangji into breaking one of the three thousand strict rules of the Gusu Lan Clanâ€”he's done it all. Although almost everything Wei Wuxian does is against Lan Wangji's principles, an unbreakable bond forms between the two. This chibi spin-off is a refreshing compilation of the hilarious and adorable moments of Mo Dao Zu Shi that shows not only how impish Wei Wuxian can be, but also the bashful side of the icy Lan Wangji.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Parent story: Mo Dao Zu Shi: Xian Yun Pian']	['Wei, Wuxian', 'Lan, Wangji', 'Jiang, Wanyin', 'Wen, Ning', 'Nie, Huaisang', 'Lan, Sizhui', 'Jiang, Yanli', 'Lan, Xichen', 'Jin, Ling', 'Yu, Ziyuan']	['Zhang, Jie', 'Bian, Jiang', 'Liu, Sanmu']	[['Mo Xiang Tong Xiu', 'Original Creator']]
