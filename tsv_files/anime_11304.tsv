Time on the Planet	Special	1	01/01/2016	-	262	5.1	144	11307	15108	The sun rises in one place and the sun sets in another.When a woman's hair grows up, a man shaves off her elongated beard.Even if the time is different, the time passes in the same way anywhere.The earth turns and the sun rises again.Each of the frames has a structure that loops indefinitely.(Source: Official website)	...
