Heartbroken and drunk after a night out, she rants about her misery to a complete strangerâ€”Kanetsugu Matou, a radio station director local to Sapporo, Hokkaido.The next day at work, Minare is shocked to hear a recording of herself from the previous night playing over the radio. Flustered, she rushes to the radio station in a frenzy to stop the broadcast. As she confronts Matou, a chain of events leads to her giving an impromptu talk live on air, explaining her savage drunken speech. With her energetic voice, she delivers a smooth dialogue with no hesitation, which Matou recognizes as raw talent.Minare soon becomes a late-night talk show host under Matou's direction, covering amusing narratives set in Sapporo, all while balancing her day job and personal life to make ends meet.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Nami yo Kiitekure']	['Koda, Minare', 'Matou, Kanetsugu', 'Nanba, Mizuho', 'Tachibana, Makie', 'Oki, Shinji', 'Nakahara, Chuuya', 'Koumoto, Ryuusuke', 'Kureko, Katsumi', 'Suga, Mitsuo', 'Takarada, Yoshiki']	['Sugiyama, Riho', 'Fuji, Shinshuu', 'Iwami, Manaka', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Uchiyama, Kouki', 'Yano, Masaaki', 'Ishikawa, Kaito', 'Yamaji, Kazuhiro', 'Namikawa, Daisuke', 'Shimada, Bin']	[['Minamikawa, Tatsuma', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Takahashi, Tsuyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Okada, Kenjirou', 'Storyboard'], ['tacica', 'Theme Song Arrangement, Theme Song Performance']]
