This has incurred the wrath of the ghosts who are becoming increasingly unhappy with the selfishness of the human kind. However, there is a conflict of interests within the ghosts in which one extreme opposes the humans completely while another extreme desires the co-existence of humans and ghosts. Kitaro and his family belongs to the latter category and yearns to seek mutual understanding between the humans and ghosts. Kitaro's fight for love and hope continues.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: GeGeGe no Kitarou', 'Alternative version: Gegege no Kitarou (2007)', 'Spin-off: Hakaba Kitarou', 'Side story: Gegege no Kitarou (1985 Movie)', 'Other: Gegege no Kitarou (2018)']	['Kitarou', 'Medama Oyaji', 'Neko Musume', 'Nezumi Otoko', 'Backbeard', 'Ittan Momen', 'Kaminari', 'Makuragaeshi', 'Wanyuudou', 'Karura']	['Toda, Keiko', 'Tanonaka, Isamu', 'Mita, Yuuko', 'Tomiyama, Kei', 'Shibata, Hidekatsu', 'Gouri, Daisuke', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Ginga, Banjou', 'Utsumi, Kenji']	[['Kasai, Osamu', 'Director, Episode Director'], ['Okazaki, Minoru', 'Episode Director'], ['Shirato, Takeshi', 'Episode Director'], ['Hoshiyama, Hiroyuki', 'Script']]
