She is attractive, good at sports, and is an all-around model student. Since they are in the same class this year, Shinozaki decides to confess his feelingsâ€”and, to his shock, Kousaka agrees to be his girlfriend!However, he finds that Kousaka is a bit stranger than he first thought: this seemingly perfect girl has never been in a relationship. But even though she is inexperienced, she vows to please Shinozaki in every way she can... such as learning multiple sex positions or his fetishes. Shinozaki tries to assure her that her studies into such subjects aren't necessary, but Kousaka devotes herself to making him happy in more ways than one.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Shojo Bitch na Ken', 'Other: Boku no Kanojo ga Majimesugiru Sho-bitch na Ken OVA']	['Kousaka, Akiho', 'Ariyama, Shizuku', 'Shinozaki, Haruka', 'Shinozaki, Kanata', 'Hoshikawa, Seiya', 'Shizumori, Sayo', 'Saijou, Rina', 'Kousaka, Fuyumi', 'Aikawa, Misaki', 'Igarashi, Saori']	['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Takeda Tago, Larissa', 'Ichiki, Mitsuhiro', 'Yagi, Yuki', 'Lounsbery, Arthur', 'Hase, Miki', 'Yamada, Natsumi', 'Saitou, Aya', 'Mizutani, Marin', 'Nagatsuma, Juri']	[['Nagayama, Nobuyoshi', 'Director'], ['Yokota, Chikako', 'Sound Director'], ['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['pua:re', 'Theme Song Performance']]
