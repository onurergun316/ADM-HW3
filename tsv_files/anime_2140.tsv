There, he boldly embarks on his plan to create his personal harem with the 4 girls who are the other council members, namely: The incredibly youthful president Sakurano Kurimu; The cool and kindly yet super-sadistic secretary Akaba Chizuru; Tomboyish and hot-blooded vice-president Shiina Minatsu; and The ephemerally beautiful yet complicated treasurer Shiina Mafuyu. While every day since then has been non-stop fun, Graduation Day now looms near. Could this spell the end of their carefree days?(Source: translated and adapted from official site by Cranston)	['Adaptation: Seitokai no Ichizon', 'Prequel: Seitokai no Ichizon', 'Side story: Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2: Watasu Seitokai']	['Sugisaki, Ken', 'Shiina, Mafuyu', 'Akaba, Chizuru', 'Sakurano, Kurimu', 'Shiina, Minatsu', 'Toudou, Elise', 'Sugisaki, Ringo', 'Toudou, Lilicia', 'Matsubara, Asuka', 'Magiru, Satori']	['Kondou, Takashi', 'Nomizu, Iori', 'Mina', 'Honda, Mariko', 'Togashi, Misuzu', 'Shimizu, Ai', 'Yonezawa, Madoka', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Koshimizu, Ami', 'Kosuge, Mami']	[['Imaizumi, Kenichi', 'Director'], ['Kunisawa, Mariko', 'Script'], ['Nomizu, Iori', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Togashi, Misuzu', 'Theme Song Performance']]
