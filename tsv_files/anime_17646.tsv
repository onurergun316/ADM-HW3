Her target: Son Ryang-ha, a notorious killer known for killing 18 high-class officials in a single night. To this day, his murders remain swift, efficient, and bloody. However, after Son Ryang-ha overpowers Chateau in their first encounter, he reveals his own intentions: he too is after her, aiming for her heart.Son Ryang-ha's attempts to catch her eye are quite unique, to say the least. He offers gifts to her in the form of her current targets, tied up and battered, and will do anything to spend more time together. Reluctantly, Chateau goes along with this act, and so begins the cat-and-mouse game of love between two killers.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Koroshi Ai']	['Song, Ryang-ha', 'Dankworth, Chateau']	['Shimono, Hiro', 'Oonishi, Saori']	[['Ooba, Hideaki', 'Director'], ['Hisao, Ayumu', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Fe', 'Original Creator'], ['Satou, Youko', 'Character Design']]
