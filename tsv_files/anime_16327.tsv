He lives with his mother, who thinks highly of him. He lays around the house, sneakily looks at Edo-period pornography without his mother noticing, naps at school, but he plans to become a respectable samurai one day!(Source: MangaHelpers, edited)	['Adaptation: Isobe Isobee Monogatari: Ukiyo wa Tsurai yo', 'Alternative version: Isobe Isobee Monogatari: Ukiyo wa Tsurai yo (2015)', 'Side story: Isobe Isobee Monogatari Jump Festa Special']	['Isobe, Isobee']	['Sakamoto, Raikou']	[['Nakama, Ryou', 'Original Creator']]
