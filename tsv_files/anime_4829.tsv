Little did the group know, they were successful and the saucer has been floating in the sky since then, waiting to fulfill its purpose.Seven years later, Nonoka returns to Kiriya, all but forgetting everything regarding her life there. She meets Noel, a little girl wearing strange clothes, and through her, Nonoka begins to remember the past and the friends she left behind. From there, she strives to reforge her severed relationship with the others as she uncovers the mysteries connecting Noel, the saucer, and the wishes they once cherished together.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Sora no Method', 'Side story: Sora no Method: Aru Shoujo no Kyuujitsu★', 'Other: Sora no Method: Mou Hitotsu no Negai']	['Noel', 'Komiya, Nonoka', 'Togawa, Shione', 'Mizusaka, Yuzuki', 'Shiihara, Koharu', 'Mizusaka, Souta', 'Komiya, Shuuichi', 'Komiya, Kaori', 'Shiihara, Mother', 'Mizusaka, Mother']	['Minase, Inori', 'Natsukawa, Shiina', 'Komatsu, Mikako', 'Toyosaki, Aki', 'Yoshimura, Haruka', 'Han, Megumi', 'Tsuchida, Hiroshi', 'Kayano, Ai', 'Satou, Rina', 'Endou, Aya']	[['Sakoi, Masayuki', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Noshitani, Mitsutaka', 'Episode Director'], ['Kitagawa, Takayuki', 'Episode Director, 2nd Key Animation, Key Animation']]
