Then, a sunny, happy-go-lucky girl named Amuro Ninagawa who transferred from Okinawa joined the club. Her extraordinary underwater speed and unorthodox swimming style (plus her personal habit of nude swimmingâ€”a powerful magnet to teenage boys) surprised every club member, especially Okiura, because she reminds him of a mermaid-like creature he saw only once in his early childhood.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Kenkou Zenrakei Suieibu Umishou']	['Ninagawa, Amuro', 'Orizuka, Momoko', 'Okiura, Kaname', 'Shizuoka, Mirei', 'Ikariya, Masa', 'Ikuta, Maki', 'Kise, Sanae', 'Ninagawa, Masashi', 'Yasu, Chigusa', 'Nanjou, Karena']	['Toyosaki, Aki', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Toyonaga, Toshiyuki', 'Fukui, Yukari', 'Yasumura, Makoto', 'Shimizu, Ai', 'Shintani, Ryouko', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Iguchi, Yuka', 'Takagaki, Ayahi']	[['Soutome, Kouichirou', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Tanaka, Kazuya', 'Sound Director'], ['Daichi, Akitarou', 'Storyboard'], ['Miyashita, Shinpei', 'Storyboard']]
