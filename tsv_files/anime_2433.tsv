The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1–21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22–40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41–50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.(Source: Wikipedia)	['Full story: Mobile Suit Gundam SEED']	['Yamato, Kira', 'Clyne, Lacus', 'Zala, Athrun', 'Athha, Cagalli Yula', 'La Flaga, Mu', 'Haro', 'Le Creuset, Rau', 'Allster, Flay', 'Joule, Yzak', 'Ramius, Murrue']	['Hoshi, Souichirou', 'Tanaka, Rie', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Shindo, Naomi', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Seki, Toshihiko', 'Kuwashima, Houko', 'Seki, Tomokazu', 'Mitsuishi, Kotono']	[['Yatate, Hajime', 'Producer'], ['Fukuda, Mitsuo', 'Director'], ['See-Saw', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Tomino, Yoshiyuki', 'Original Creator']]
