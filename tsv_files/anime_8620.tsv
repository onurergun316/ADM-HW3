Cestvs: The Roman Fighter	TV	11	04/15/2021	04/15/2021	16937	6.0	4720	8622	4326	In the year 54 AD, 15-year-old slave fighter Cestvs desires one thingâ€”an escape from his violent life. It is the wish Cestvs' owner has promised to grant him, but only after he wins 100 battles. However, Cestvs quickly comes to terms with the fact that, as a slave, his life is expendable. After the death of his friend, the possibility of freedom is the only thing keeping him going. With a burning ambition to attain it, Cestvs embarks on a journey to earn himself back, even if it means fighting other slaves for the entertainment of the public.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kentou Ankokuden Cestvs']	['Cestvs', 'Zafar', 'Roxane', 'Nero', 'Demitorius', 'Narrator', 'Sabina', 'Demitorius, Ruska Atticus', 'Agrippina', 'Emden']	['Mineta, Hiromu', 'Koyama, Rikiya', 'Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Uemura, Yuuto', 'Touchi, Hiroki', 'Ootsuka, Akio', 'Endou, Aya', 'Ono, Kensho', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Takeuchi, Ryouta']	[['Kawase, Toshifumi', 'Director, Script, Series Composition'], ['Monma, Kazuya', 'Director'], ['Nakano, Tooru', 'Sound Director'], ['Tokuda, Masahiro', 'Music']]
