However, the fate of the future queen of France is set in stone—at the young age of 15, she has to leave her family and marry the crown prince of France.At the same time in France, a girl is born in the family of the Commander of the Royal Guards. Upset at not having a male heir, her father decides to raise her as a man and names the girl Oscar. Oscar is trained from a young age to become the leader of the Royal Guards, but she is yet to discern that the will of the queen sometimes does not equal the good of the people.Based on the critically acclaimed manga by Riyoko Ikeda, Rose of Versailles depicts the fateful meeting of Marie Antoinette and Oscar, which is bound to influence history and change the life of the people facing the French Revolution as the clock ticks toward the end of the French royalty.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Versailles no Bara', 'Summary: Versailles no Bara: Seimei Aru Kagiri Aishite', 'Alternative version: La Rose de Versailles']	['de Jarjeyes, Oscar François', 'Grandier, André', 'Antoinette, Marie', 'Lamorlière, Rosalie', 'Fersen, Hans Axel von', 'Valois de la Motte, Jeanne', 'de Soisson, Alain', 'du Barry, Jeanne Becu', 'Robespierre, Maximilien', 'Louis XVI']	['Tajima, Reiko', 'Shigaki, Taro', 'Ueda, Miyuki', 'Yoshida, Rihoko', 'Hori, Katsunosuke', 'Matsukane, Yoneko', 'Yamada, Keaton', 'Kinomiya, Ryouko', 'Mori, Katsuji', 'Yasuhara, Yoshito']	"[['Dezaki, Osamu', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Nagahama, Tadao', 'Director, Chief Animation Director'], ['Nishikubo, Mizuho', 'Episode Director'], [""D'Avena, Cristina"", 'Theme Song Performance']]"
