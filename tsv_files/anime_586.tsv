Youjo Senki	TV	12	01/06/2017	01/06/2017	720307	7.98	381799	586	175	"Tanya Degurechaff is a young soldier infamous for predatorial-like ruthlessness and an uncanny, tactical aptitude, earning her the nickname of the ""Devil of the Rhine."" Underneath her innocuous appearance, however, lies the soul of a man who challenged Being X, the self-proclaimed God, to a battle of witsâ€”which resulted in him being reincarnated as a little girl into a world of magical warfare. Hellbent on defiance, Tanya resolves to ascend the ranks of her country's military as it slowly plunges into world war, with only Being X proving to be the strongest obstacle in recreating the peaceful life she once knew. But her perceptive actions and combat initiative have an unintended side effect: propelling the mighty Empire into becoming one of the most powerful nations in mankind's history.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Youjo Senki', 'Other: Youjo Shenki Episode 0', 'Summary: Youjo Senki: Senkyou Houkoku', 'Sequel: Youjo Senki Movie', 'Character: Isekai Quartet', 'Side story: Youjo Senki: Sabaku no Pasta Daisakusen']	['Degurechaff, Tanya', 'Serebryakova, Viktoriya Ivanovna', 'von Zettour, Hans', 'von Lergen, Erich', 'Sioux, Mary', 'von Rudersdorf, Kurt', 'Weiss, Matheus Johann', 'Existence X', 'von Schugel, Adelheid', 'Sioux, Anson']	['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Hayami, Saori', 'Ootsuka, Houchuu', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Tomatsu, Haruka', 'Genda, Tesshou', 'Hamano, Daiki', 'Tezuka, Hideaki', 'Tobita, Nobuo', 'Horiuchi, Kenyuu']	[['Uemura, Yutaka', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Akamatsu, Yasuhiro', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Ihara, Kenta', 'Script, Series Composition']]
