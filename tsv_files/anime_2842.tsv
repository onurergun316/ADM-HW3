Date A Live II	TV	10	04/12/2014	04/12/2014	524513	7.21	320026	2844	306	Spirits are otherworldly entities with immense power, capable of creating spatial quakes whenever they appear. One way of dealing with them is through brute force and killing them... or making them fall in love and sealing their powers. Having sealed three Spirits, Shidou Itsuka continues his mission with Ratatoskr in locating more spirits and dating them, to ensure the world's safety from further destruction. However, this time around, their problems will not be limited to Spirits as a more imposing threat seems to have noticed their activities.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Date A Live', 'Prequel: Date A Live: Date to Date', 'Side story: Date A Live II: Kurumi Star Festival', 'Sequel: Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment']	['Yatogami, Tooka', 'Tobiichi, Origami', 'Yoshino', 'Itsuka, Kotori', 'Itsuka, Shidou', 'Izayoi, Miku', 'Tokisaki, Kurumi', 'Yamai, Yuzuru', 'Yamai, Kaguya', 'Murasame, Reine']	['Inoue, Marina', 'Togashi, Misuzu', 'Nomizu, Iori', 'Taketatsu, Ayana', 'Zougou, Saeko', 'Chihara, Minori', 'Sanada, Asami', 'Bridcutt, Sarah Emi', 'Uchida, Maaya', 'Endou, Aya']	[['Motonaga, Keitarou', 'Director'], ['Ebina, Yasunori', 'Sound Director'], ['Aizawa, Masahiro', 'Storyboard, Chief Animation Director'], ['Iwahata, Gouichi', 'Storyboard']]
