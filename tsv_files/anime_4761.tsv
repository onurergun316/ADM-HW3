Gate Keepers 21	OVA	6	04/24/2002	04/24/2002	9750	6.77	4219	4763	5353	Thirty-two years have passed since the initial defeat of the Invaders. A.E.G.I.S is all but dismantled now and has become an underground organization consisting of only a few Gate Keepers left to save humanity. One of the members, Ayane Isuzu, is sick of society as a whole, though she continues to defeat the Invaders out of spite for her father. Suddenly, she learns of the revival of Machine General (Kikai Shogun) and Devil Count (Akuma Hakushaku), but a mysterious ghost girl now accompanies them. It is up to Ayane and the remnants of A.E.G.I.S to stop them and save humanity once again.(Source: ANN)	['Prequel: Gate Keepers']	['Isuzu, Ayane', 'Tachikawa, Satoka', 'Manaduru, Miu', 'Houjou, Yukino', 'Kageyama, Reiji', 'Itou, Naoko', 'Hashimoto, Daisuke', 'Watanabe, Chinami', 'Ghost Girl']	['Ootani, Ikue', 'Nogawa, Sakura', 'Hanioka, Yukiko', 'Suzuki, Masami', 'Seki, Tomokazu', 'Takano, Naoko', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Nishimura, Chinami', 'Noto, Mamiko']	[['Watanabe, Takashi', 'Producer'], ['Yamaguchi, Hiroshi', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Satou, Junichi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
