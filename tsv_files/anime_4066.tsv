Animal Yokochou	TV	51	10/04/2005	10/04/2005	2463	6.92	535	4086	8890	On the first day her family moved to their new house, 5-year-old Ami-chan made friends with three talking animals who came out of a door in her bedroom floor, which she finds out leads to Animal Yokocho, another world. The three are Issa, an overly innocent, soft-spoken panda, Kenta, a highly strung, red-scarf-loving bear who puts on an almost constant tough-guy act, and Iyo, a rabbit who usually holds her own well-being and enjoyment over the happiness (and safety) of her friends. Even at only 5 years old, Ami-chan is easily the most rational of the group, and she's a little wary at first, but she eventually comes around and starts spending her free time with them. A typical day involves Ami-chan and the three doing different things to pass the time, often playing a seemingly innocent game, but in AniYoko style. Unfortunately for Ami-chan, the AniYoko version usually turns out to be drastically different, much less logical, and usually more dangerous than the ordinary version.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Animal Yokochou']	['Iyo', 'Matsuzaki, Ami', 'Kenta', 'Issa', 'Matsuzaki, Ayako', 'Takeda, Kumiko']	['Shishido, Rumi', 'Erika', 'Nagasawa, Nao', 'Satou, Yuuko', 'Suzuki, Naoko', 'Fukuhara, Kaori']	[['Nishimoto, Yukio', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Matsuoka, Hiroki', 'Sound Director'], ['Okada, Mari', 'Script'], ['Sasano, Megumu', 'Script']]
