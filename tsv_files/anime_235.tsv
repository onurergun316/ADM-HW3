Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of Battousai still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.Unbeknownst to them, Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as Kenshin Himura, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, Kenshin dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai. After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan tells the story of Kenshin as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan', 'Prequel: Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku-hen', 'Side story: Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Ishinshishi e no Chinkonka', 'Sequel: Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Seisou-hen', 'Alternative version: Rurouni Kenshin DVD-BOX Special Ending', 'Summary: Rurouni Kenshin Recap', 'Other: Sobakasu']	['Himura, Kenshin', 'Sagara, Sanosuke', 'Kamiya, Kaoru', 'Myoujin, Yahiko', 'Saitou, Hajime', 'Shishio, Makoto', 'Seta, Soujirou', 'Hiko, Seijuurou', 'Shinomori, Aoshi', 'Makimachi, Misao']	['Suzukaze, Mayo', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Fujitani, Miki', 'Tominaga, Miina', 'Suzuoki, Hirotaka', 'Ikeda, Masanori', 'Hidaka, Noriko', 'Ikeda, Shuuichi', 'Yasuhara, Yoshito', 'Sakurai, Tomo']	[['Furuhashi, Kazuhiro', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Yoshida, Shunji', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Chigira, Kouichi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Sokuza, Makoto', 'Episode Director']]
