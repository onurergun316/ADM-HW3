Teizokurei Daydream	OVA	4	06/25/2004	06/25/2004	9217	6.17	3687	7820	5474	Saiki Misaki has been able to see ghosts since she was a kid. Now, working at an S&M club, her spare time goes to sending the spirits off to the other world by having to make them realize they're dead and have to leave. This would supposedly be a little bit easier if you didnt have a background of hardship and loneliness... and a perverted employer.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Teizokurei Daydream']	['Saiki, Misaki', 'Kunugi, Ai', 'Kadotake, Souichiro', 'Ichinose', 'Fujiwara, Mitsuru', 'Shibata', 'Reporter Haruta', 'Otaguro', 'Koga', 'Yamazaki, Detective']	['Asano, Masumi', 'Tamura, Yukari', 'Sugita, Tomokazu', 'Ito, Mai', 'Kishio, Daisuke', 'Ogata, Mitsuru', 'Hoshino, Mitsuaki', 'Houki, Katsuhisa', 'Futamata, Issei', 'Kanao, Tetsuo']	[['Sekita, Osamu', 'Director'], ['Takahashi, Hideo', 'Sound Director'], ['Sayama, Kiyoko', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Nishimoto, Yukio', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
