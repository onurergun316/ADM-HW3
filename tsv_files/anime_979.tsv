Aoi Miyamori keeps busy dealing with the ordinary troubles in her daily work at Musashino Animation. After a morning meeting, Watanabe talks to Aoi and puts her in charge of a new theatrical anime project for the studio. The project has unexpected problems, and Aoi is unsure if the company can proceed with a theatrical anime with its current state of affairs. While dealing with that anxiety, Aoi meets a new colleague named Kaede Miyai (voiced by Ayane Sakura). She and the MusAni team work together to complete the project.(Source: ANN)	['Prequel: Shirobako']	['Miyamori, Aoi', 'Yasuhara, Ema', 'Sakaki, Shizuka', 'Imai, Midori', 'Toudou, Misa', 'Miyai, Kaede', 'Yano, Erika', 'Ogasawara, Rinko', 'Kinoshita, Seiichi', 'Kunogi, Ai']	['Kimura, Juri', 'Yoshimura, Haruka', 'Chisuga, Haruka', 'Oowada, Hitomi', 'Takano, Asami', 'Sakura, Ayane', 'Yamaoka, Yuri', 'Kayano, Ai', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Izawa, Shiori']	[['Mizushima, Tsutomu', 'Director'], ['Yokote, Michiko', 'Script'], ['fhána', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Ponkan⑧', 'Original Character Design']]
