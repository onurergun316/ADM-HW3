However, young Mamori will soon have to get used to being teased in other ways...Kidnapped during gym class, Mamori wakes up only to find herself stranded and under attack on the exotic island of Mermaid. Luckily, enigmatic fellow castaway Mirei Shikishima knows exactly how to take the lead—through a passionate kiss, Mirei unleashes Mamori's Exter transformation abilities, turning the innocent red-head into a battle-ready cutlass through the power of arousal.The duo will need to tap into that power as Mermaid Island is full of potential friends and foes: Charlotte, the sadistic Liberator of an Exter harem; the gluttonous and crafty Meifon; the mysterious but charismatic Akira Hiiragi; and the erotic biker duo Lady Lady. Mamori and Mirei's powerful and intimate embrace is the only way for the pair to ensure their survival on this scandalous island.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid', 'Side story: Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid Specials']	['Shikishima, Mirei', 'Tokonome, Mamori', 'Lady J', 'Sakura, Meifon', 'Hasumi, Rayne', 'Hiiragi, Akira', 'Sagara, Momoka', 'Scherzen, Charlotte', 'Kazami, Torino', 'Shigure, Kasumi']	['Iguchi, Yuka', 'Izawa, Mikako', 'Asakura, Azumi', 'Kubo, Yurika', 'Oonishi, Saori', 'Yoshino, Yuna', 'Harada, Hitomi', 'Seto, Asami', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Tazawa, Masumi']	[['Kaneko, Hiraku', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Noshitani, Mitsutaka', 'Episode Director'], ['Iguchi, Yuka', 'Theme Song Performance']]
