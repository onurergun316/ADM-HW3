While frequenting his favorite bar, he is approached by a friendly man named Toyohi Utsumi. Having always dreamt of being a wizard, Toyohi is enthralled by the idea of meeting one. Much to the young Captain's surprise, Toyohi confesses that he has fallen in love with Kashima. While little time as passed, the two begin to spend more time together. Not all is well, however, as Kashima fears that magic is all that he has and Toyohi is only in love with Kashima the Wizard.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Other: Kono Danshi, Uchuujin to Tatakaemasu.']	['Utsumi, Toyohi', 'Kashima, Chiharu', 'Zaou']	['Yashiro, Taku', 'Ono, Yuuki', 'Kuwahata, Yuusuke']	[['Yamamoto, Soubi', 'Director'], ['Aoi, Shouta', 'Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Composition'], ['Lenti, Marissa', 'ADR Director']]
