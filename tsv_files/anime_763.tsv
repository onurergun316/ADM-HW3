Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu	TV	14	04/03/2006	04/03/2006	810928	7.85	421908	763	144	Kyon, your typical high school student, has long given up his belief in the supernatural. However, upon meeting Haruhi Suzumiya, he quickly finds out that it is the supernatural that she is interested inâ€”aliens, time travelers, and espers among other things. When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade is formed, a club which specializes in all that is the supernatural.Much to his chagrin, Kyon, along with the silent bookworm, Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the perpetually smiling Itsuki Koizumi, are recruited as members. The story follows the crazy adventures that these four endure under their whimsical leader, Haruhi. The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Suzumiya Haruhi Series', 'Side story: Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009)', 'Spin-off: Suzumiya Haruhi-chan no Yuuutsu', 'Sequel: Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu']	"['Suzumiya, Haruhi', 'Kyon', 'Nagato, Yuki', 'Asahina, Mikuru', 'Koizumi, Itsuki', 'Tsuruya', 'Asakura, Ryouko', ""Kyon's Sister"", 'Shamisen', 'Okabe']"	['Hirano, Aya', 'Sugita, Tomokazu', 'Chihara, Minori', 'Gotou, Yuuko', 'Ono, Daisuke', 'Matsuoka, Yuki', 'Kuwatani, Natsuko', 'Aoki, Sayaka', 'Ogata, Kenichi', 'Yanagisawa, Eiji']	[['Hatta, Youko', 'Producer'], ['Ishihara, Tatsuya', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Takemoto, Yasuhiro', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
