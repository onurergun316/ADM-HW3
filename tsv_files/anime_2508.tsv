Poputepipikku	TV	12	01/07/2018	01/07/2018	188342	7.28	83565	2511	954	Poputepipikku turns absurdist comedy up to eleven with its pop culture references and surreal hilarity. With two bonafide high school girl protagonists—the short and exceptionally quick to anger Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi—they throw genres against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching goal—to become a real anime.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Poputepipikku', 'Sequel: Poputepipikku TV Special', 'Other: Ninja Batman x Poputepipikku Kindan no Collab CM']	['Popuko', 'Pipimi', 'Hoshifuri, Sosogu', 'Taira, Daichi', 'Mother Penguin', 'J.
