Madlax	TV	26	04/06/2004	04/06/2004	37171	7.04	11436	3626	2932	In the country of Gazth-Sonika, civil war rages. There, a mercenary called Madlax plies her trade, with almost supernatural skill. In the seemingly peaceful country of Nafrece, Margaret Burton lives a tranquil life. As separate as their lives may seem, the two are connected by ties of mystery, and by a holy book that is also sought by the shadowy organisation, Enfant. As Margaret and Madlax follow the path of their destiny, they come ever closer to uncovering the truth - with no guarantee that it is a truth they can bear to learn.(Source: ANN)	 	['Madlax', 'Baker, Elenore', 'Burton, Margaret', 'Doon, Carrossea', 'Rene, Vanessa', 'Monday, Friday', 'Jorg, Limelda', 'Nakhl', 'Laetitia', 'Lopez']	['Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Uchikawa, Ai', 'Kuwashima, Houko', 'Morikawa, Toshiyuki', 'Yukino, Satsuki', 'Ebara, Masashi', 'Hisakawa, Aya', 'Nakano, Chikayo', 'Kaneda, Tomoko', 'Ishida, Akira']	[['Kitayama, Shigeru', 'Producer, Screenplay'], ['Mashimo, Kouichi', 'Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Nakano, Tooru', 'Sound Director'], ['Kurokawa, Tomoyuki', 'Episode Director']]
