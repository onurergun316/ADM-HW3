However, her cold view of life begins to change when she meets Haru Yoshida, a violent troublemaker who stopped attending class after getting into a fight early in the school year. He is not much different from her, thoughâ€”he too understands little about human nature and does not have any friends. Much to Shizuku's surprise, he proclaims that she will be his friend and immediately confesses his feelings toward her upon meeting her.Because of her lack of friends and social interaction, Shizuku has a hard time understanding her relationship with Haru. But slowly, their friendship begins to progress, and she discovers that there is more to Haru than violence. She begins todevelop feelings for him, but is unsure what kind of emotions she is experiencing. Together, Shizuku and Haru explore the true nature of their relationship and emotions.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun', 'Alternative setting: Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun: Tonari no Gokudou-kun']	['Yoshida, Haru', 'Mizutani, Shizuku', 'Natsume, Asako', 'Yamaguchi, Kenji', 'Sasahara, Souhei', 'Misawa, Mitsuyoshi', 'Yoshida, Yuuzan', 'Ooshima, Chizuru', 'Mizutani, Takaya', 'Miyama, Yuu']	['Suzuki, Tatsuhisa', 'Tomatsu, Haruka', 'Tanezaki, Atsumi', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Oosaka, Ryouta', 'Higuchi, Tomoyuki', 'Sawashiro, Miyuki', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Murase, Ayumu', 'Yahagi, Sayuri']	[['Kaburagi, Hiro', 'Director'], ['Ishiguro, Kyouhei', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Deai, Kotomi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Umemoto, Yui', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
