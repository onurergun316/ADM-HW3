With the addition of exciting new features such as missions and story events, the GBN experience is more immersive than ever before. Amidst the player base, a user known as Hiroto Kuga has been gaining notoriety for his top-notch skills.Through a series of coincidences, Hiroto meets three other players: the boastful Kazami Torimachi, the mysterious May, and the timid Parviz. Forming the ""BUILD DiVERS,"" the unlikely group sets on a story mission rumored to carry bountiful in-game rewards. Together, the BUILD DiVERS must confront their own weaknesses as they join arms in a journey that may very well transcend the existence of GBN itself.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Prequel: Gundam Build Divers', 'Sequel: Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise 2nd Season']	['May', 'Kuga, Hiroto', 'Freddie', 'Torimachi, Kazami', 'Parviz', 'Magee', 'Mukai, Hinata', 'Eve', 'Maiya', 'Nanase, Nanami']	['Fuchigami, Mai', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Kakuma, Ai', 'Mizunaka, Masaaki', 'Minami, Mayu', 'Murata, Taishi', 'Wakayama, Shion', 'Minase, Inori', 'Mimura, Yuuna']	[['Watada, Shinya', 'Director'], ['Mutou, Yasuyuki', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Spira Spica', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['SudannaYuzuYully', 'Theme Song Performance']]
