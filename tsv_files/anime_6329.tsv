This delinquent turns out to be her new classmate, Kyouta Tsubaki. Kyouta teases Hibino, drawing attention to their similar last names. The two are both top of their class, but are different in every other way. Even though it seems that they cannot stand each other, fate has something else in store for themâ€¦	['Adaptation: Kyou, Koi wo Hajimemasu']	['Tsubaki, Kyouta', 'Hibino, Tsubaki', 'Hibino, Sakura', 'Hasegawa, Nishiki', 'Yuki', 'Ichikura, Miho']	['Namikawa, Daisuke', 'Itou, Kanae', 'Yahagi, Sayuri', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka', 'Ise, Mariya']	[['Yamauchi, Shigeyasu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Itou, Kanae', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['French Kiss', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Minami, Kanan', 'Original Creator']]
