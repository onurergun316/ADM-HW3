Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai	TV	12	01/13/2019	01/13/2019	28994	6.86	8112	4354	3344	In a barren frontier where people trade goods with each other in order to help each other survive. The Kotobuki Squadron are bodyguards for hire, led by a strict but beautiful squadron leader, an unreliable commanding officer, and a true artisan of a crew chief. Alongside pilots who don't lack for personality, they take to the air in dogfights, letting the engine noise of their Hayabusa fighters ring out in the skies.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai', 'Spin-off: Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai Gaiden: Oozora no Harukaze Hikoutai', 'Alternative version: Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai Kanzenban']	['Kylie', 'Reona', 'Zara', 'Kate', 'Emma', 'Chika', 'Tamiru']	['Suzushiro, Sayumi', 'Seto, Asami', 'Yamamura, Hibiku', 'Nakaya, Sayaka', 'Yukimura, Eri', 'Tomita, Miyu']	[['Mizushima, Tsutomu', 'Director, Sound Director, Storyboard'], ['Kanbe, Hiroyuki', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Assistant Director, Animation Director'], ['Saotome, Yuusaku', 'Episode Director'], ['Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Script']]
