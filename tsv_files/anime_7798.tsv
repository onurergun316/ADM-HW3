Ten Little Gall Force	OVA	1	07/03/1988	-	1486	6.18	532	7801	10197	"A super deformed parody which depicts the ""making of "" Eternal Story and Destruction. A very humorous behind-the-scenes look (if ""Gall Force"" were a live-action series instead of being animated). Cast and crew members run into severe and embarrassing difficulties as things do not turn out as they should; for example, Lufy totally drowns in embarrassment as she is object of a whole crowd of spectators while in the nude; the director's obsession with realistic filming causes some real high-voltage friction with Catty; and in the end, after the premiere, the girls end up in an ongoing on-stage tussle about which one is the most popular character.(Source: Wikipedia)"	['Spin-off: Gall Force 1: Eternal Story', 'Other: Scramble Wars: Tsuppashire!
