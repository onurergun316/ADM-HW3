Guided by what seems to be a miracle, a handful of students are fortunate enough to be reincarnated into another world as nobles, princes, and other kinds of people with prestigious backgrounds.One girl, however, is not so lucky. Being reborn as a spider of the weakest kind, she immediately experiences the hardships of her dire situation. Even so, she must press on to survive the numerous threats that endanger her life. Discovering that her new world has a system like that of an RPG, she tries her best to hunt prey and defeat monsters to level up and evolve. As she gradually grows stronger, she hopes one day her efforts will be rewarded, and that she will be granted a better life.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kumo desu ga, Nani ka?']	['Kumoko', 'Feirune', 'Ariel', 'Keren, Sophia', 'D', 'Wrath', 'Anabald, Karnatia Seri', 'Harrifenas, Potimas', 'Harrifenas, Filim√∏s', 'Zagan Analeit, Suelecia']	['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Uesaka, Sumire', 'Taketatsu, Ayana', 'Hayami, Saori', 'Oosaka, Ryouta', 'Touyama, Nao', 'Okuno, Kaya', 'Ogura, Yui']	[['Itagaki, Shin', 'Director, Sound Director'], ['Imaizumi, Yuuichi', 'Sound Director'], ['Yuuki, Aoi', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Suzuki, Konomi', 'Theme Song Performance']]
