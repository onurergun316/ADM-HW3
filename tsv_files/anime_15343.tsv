Da Zuiba Dudu	TV	52			216		0	15349	15725	Considered a shanzhai version of Crayon Shin-chan. Dudu is a kindergartner who gets in to lots of trouble while making frequent butt/fart jokes. Most episodes revolve around him and his friends that usually end with a recap half-heartedly attempting a moral lesson to be taught.
