Plus Kouji	Special	2	08/28/2017	08/28/2017	145		0	12798	17033	A collaboration between Ukkari Pénélope and Marukome for the latter's new product line of amazake, a drink made from fermented rice. Plus Kouji is based on a kouji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) enzyme which allows Marukome's product to contain 0% alcohol and be sugar-free so it is perfectly healthy for pregnant women, babies, and the eldery to drink while keeping the same taste as traditional amazake (which is normally sweet and mildly alcoholic).
