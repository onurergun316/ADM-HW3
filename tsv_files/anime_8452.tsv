Jishu Seisaku Movie Binchou-tan	NA	1	08/14/2005	-	2322	6.05	1203	8455	9044	Binchou-tan wakes up in her tattered wooden hut only to discover that her water barrel is almost empty. She decides to go to the nearby stream, only to find the fast-flowing water to be brown. Walking the path to town, past green fields, Binchou-tan finally reaches an old water pump on the central marketplace, and fills her wooden bucket. On the way home it starts to rain, so she lets the rain fill the bucket to the rim, preparing herself for the next work day.(Source: AniDB)	['Other: Binchou-tan']	['Binchou-tan']	[]	[['Ishikawa, Naoya', 'Director, Key Animation, In-Between Animation'], ['Morita, Shunsuke', 'Theme Song Composition, Music'], ['LOOPCUBE', 'Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Performance'], ['Ekusa, Takahito', 'Background Art, Key Animation, Original Creator']]
