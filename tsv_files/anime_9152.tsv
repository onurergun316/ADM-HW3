Little Nemo Pilot (1987)	Special	1	01/01/1987	-	762	5.87	312	9155	11834	Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland was released in American theaters in 1992. However, at one point earlier in its development many people from Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro) had been involved with the project. In 1984 they produced a test pilot. In 1987, Osamu Dezaki directed a third one (as a very first one was made by Sadao Tsukioka in the mid-1970s).
