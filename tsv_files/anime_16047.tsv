His liberal thinking gets him in bad terms with his parents, teachers and childhood friend Aoi, with only his biker sister Moe to understand him. One day, after an exceptionally upsetting day at school, Yuu jumps on his motorbike and - with some help from Moe's friend Tetsuo - leaves home to have a taste of a different way of life, like making the clock turn left for a change.(Source: ANN)	"[""Adaptation: Hidari no O'Clock!!""]"	[]	[]
