Hataraku Saibou!!	TV	8	01/09/2021	01/09/2021	210248	7.32	59022	2303	852	The cells of the human body never rest for too long; there's always something new to do and learn every day. At least, that's what Hakkekkyuu U-1146 feels as he rushes to and fro, searching for any pathogens that could cause harm to the body. Despite his dangerous line of work, it's all worth it to protect the happy smiles of Sekkekkyuu AE3803, the platelet crew, his fellow neutrophils, and the other cells he meets along the way. In his latest pathogen-hunting adventures, Hakkekkyuu U-1146 discovers how important cells can sometimes make mistakes, and that not all bacteria are actually bad. Everybody has their bad days, but everything eventually works out when their comrades have their backs. In the end, it's just another normal day for these hardworking cells![Written by MAL Rewrite]	"['Adaptation: Hataraku Saibou', 'Prequel: Hataraku Saibou (TV)', 'Other: Hataraku Saibou!!: Saikyou no Teki, Futatabi.
