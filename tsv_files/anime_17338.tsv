Pluto	NA	0			8213		0		5793	Based off of a story arc from Osamu Tezuka's Tetsuwan Atom, Pluto follows the Europol detective Gesicht as he tries to uncover the mystery behind a string of robot and human deaths. The case becomes much more puzzling when evidence leans toward the murders being the work of a robot, which is something that hasn't happened for 8 years.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Pluto']	['Gesicht', 'Atom']	[]	[['Maruyama, Masao', 'Producer'], ['Urasawa, Naoki', 'Original Creator'], ['Tezuka, Osamu', 'Original Creator']]
