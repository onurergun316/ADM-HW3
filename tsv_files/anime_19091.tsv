Pico to Chico	OVA	1	04/19/2007	-	65219	4.38	41813		2158	The crisp rays of summer sun find the effeminate Pico embroiled in yet another heated and lustful fling. While out biking, Pico meets and befriends Chicoâ€”a lively boy not much younger than him, but leagues behind in the affairs of the flesh. After the innocent Chico shows his sister in the midst of self-pleasure to Pico, Pico takes it upon himself to educate this confused youth.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Prequel: Boku no Pico', 'Sequel: Pico x CoCo x Chico']	['Pico', 'Chico', 'Manko']	['Sakou, Mariko']	[['Yatabe, Katsuyoshi', 'Director'], ['Takayama, Katsuhiko', 'Script'], ['Pico', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Yoshiten', 'Character Design, Animation Director']]
