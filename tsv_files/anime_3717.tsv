Kamen no Maid Guy	TV	12	04/06/2008	04/06/2008	38049	7.02	16760	3719	2896	Fujiwara Naeka is a typical 17-year-old high school student. Or so we thought. She's really one of two surviving heirs of a tycoon who has the right to inherit his mass fortune when she turns 18 in half a year. Fubuki, a young and beautiful maid, and Kogarashi, a big burly maid guy with a mask, have been assigned to keep Naeka and her brother Kousuke safe from those who would plot their demise, and to steal the fortune she would inherit.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Kamen no Maid Guy', 'Side story: Kamen no Maid Guy: Ano Natsu, Ichiban Yutaka na Chichi.']	['Kogarashi', 'Fujiwara, Naeka', 'Fubuki', 'Fujiwara, Kousuke', 'Shizuku', 'Breast Club President', 'Strawberryfield, Hendrick K.', 'Priestess', 'Arayashiki, Yoshie', 'Hyochuka']	['Koyama, Rikiya', 'Iguchi, Yuka', 'Toyoguchi, Megumi', 'Sakaguchi, Daisuke', 'Kanda, Akemi', 'Kawashima, Tokuyoshi', 'Takahashi, Hiroki', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka', 'Yamaguchi, Mayumi', 'Tanaka, Atsuko']	[['Sakoi, Masayuki', 'Director'], ['Takakuwa, Hajime', 'Sound Director'], ['Usui, Fumiaki', 'Episode Director'], ['Ootani, Hajime', 'Episode Director']]
