Between the two girls, the atmosphere is tense, which eventually leads to Shouko calling Karada childish.Later, Karada stands before a shrine praying to grow up. Little does she know that the shrine wishing stone would grant her wish. As Karada grows older, at the same time, Shouko, who happens to be nearby, finds herself a child once again. With their ages now reversed, Shouko and Karada must come to terms with one another and ultimately themselves.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Asatte no Houkou.']	['Nogami, Shouko', 'Iokawa, Hiro', 'Iokawa, Karada', 'Amino, Tetsumasa', 'Shionzaki, Kotomi', 'Isogai, Tadashi', 'Okudera, Masao', 'Yoshimura, Takumi', 'Amino, Harue', 'Amino, Touko']	['Itou, Shizuka', 'Hino, Satoshi', 'Fujimura, Ayumi', 'Nomura, Katsuhito', 'Koshimizu, Ami', 'Suzuki, Takuma', 'Saizen, Tadahisa', 'Domon, Jin', 'Oda, Fumi', 'Watanabe, Akeno']	[['Sakurabi, Katsushi', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Takashima, Daisuke', 'Episode Director'], ['Minakami, Seishi', 'Script, Series Composition']]
