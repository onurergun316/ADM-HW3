Amagami SS	TV	25	07/02/2010	07/02/2010	326711	7.32	135698	2290	517	Two years ago, Junichi Tachibana had a date on Christmas Eve but was stood up instead. Since then, he has had a hard time showing others his true feelings in fear of being rejected again. However, as luck would have it, Junichi may have a second chance at love when he meets several girls whom he becomes romantically interested in: Haruka Morishima, the energetic and popular upperclassman with a love for cute things; Kaoru Tanamachi, his childhood friend who harbors secret feelings for him; Sae Nakata, the timid transfer student who is shy around men; Ai Nanasaki, a girl on the swim team who has a bad first impression of Junichi; Rihoko Sakurai, a childhood friend with a love for sweets; and Tsukasa Ayatsuji, a seemingly perfect class representative who has a hidden dark side. As Christmas Eve approaches, Junichi can only hope that this will be the year he will finally spend the holidays with the one he truly loves.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Amagami: Precious Diary', 'Side story: Amagami SS OVA', 'Sequel: Amagami SS+ Plus', 'Other: Seiren']	['Morishima, Haruka', 'Ayatsuji, Tsukasa', 'Nanasaki, Ai', 'Tanamachi, Kaoru', 'Nakata, Sae', 'Sakurai, Rihoko', 'Tachibana, Junichi', 'Tachibana, Miya', 'Kamizaki, Risa', 'Tsukahara, Hibiki']	['Itou, Shizuka', 'Nazuka, Kaori', 'Yukana', 'Satou, Rina', 'Konno, Hiromi', 'Shintani, Ryouko', 'Saitou, Momoko', 'Asumi, Kana', 'Kadowaki, Mai', 'Asakawa, Yuu']	[['Nakamura, Shinichi', 'Producer'], ['Matsuura, Hiroaki', 'Producer'], ['Hiraike, Yoshimasa', 'Director, Series Composition'], ['Iida, Satoki', 'Sound Director']]
