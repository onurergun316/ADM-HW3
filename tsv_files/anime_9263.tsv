Zannen Onna Kanbu Black General-san	ONA	10	06/05/2017	06/05/2017	1956	5.83	238	9266	9516	Miss Black General is the villainous leader of RX, a secret organization bent on world-domination. Unfortunately, Miss Black General also has a huge crush on Brave Man, a costumed superhero dedicated to foiling RX's evil schemes, and she often mistakes his violent heroics for an overly enthusiastic form of flirtation. So how exactly is she going to to conquer the world when she can't even conquer her own feelings? And how will Brave Man respond to this odd twist?(Source: HoboP)	['Adaptation: Zannen Onna Kanbu Black General-san']	['Miss Black General', 'Braveman', 'Scientist']	['Tanaka, Aimi', 'Sakamaki, Mitsuhiro', 'Kaho, Narumi']	[['Ueno, Isamu', 'Director'], ['jin', 'Original Creator']]
