Oh! Super Milk-chan	TV	12	01/27/2000	01/27/2000	4812	5.99	1914	8669	7104	Milk-chan is a drooling, potty-mouthed baby who lives in an apartment with an obsolete robot named Tetsuko, a slug named Hanage, and an uncontrollable pet named Robodog. Whenever the President calls, Milk-chan and the gang rush to the scene to solve any type of problem - whether it's stopping a money counterfeiter hungry for Belgian waffles or counselling a school of drunk fish. At the same time, they have to avoid a nagging landlord, as they're six months behind their rent.(Source: ANN)	['Prequel: Super Milk-chan', 'Side story: Oh!
