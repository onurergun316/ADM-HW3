Call Me Tonight	OVA	1	07/28/1986	-	8698	5.26	4540	10986	5613	Rumi's met a lot of guys through her job, and it's probably fair to assume that most of them could be said to have some sort of problem, but a man who literally turns into a beast when he gets turned on may be outside of this perky call girl's field of expertise. Still, a little challenge every now and again stimulates the mind and makes life so much more interesting, so she's willing to give it a shot.(Source: AniDB)	['Other: Gakuen Tokusou Hikaruon']	['Natsumi, Rumi', 'Nohara, Oyuki', 'Sugiura, Ryo', 'Hayata', 'Nohara, Maki']	['Tamagawa, Sakiko', 'Koujiro, Chie', 'Toriumi, Katsumi', 'Seki, Toshihiko', 'Ukai, Rumiko']	[['Yamada, Etsuji', 'Sound Director'], ['Yamanaka, Norimasa', 'Theme Song Arrangement, Theme Song Composition, Music'], ['Takami, Akio', 'Key Animation'], ['Yamasaki, Osamu', 'Key Animation, Animation Director']]
