Her teacher, Mr. Shirakawa, is often frustrated with her playing. Although she plays every note exactly correct, her heart just isn't in it...Meanwhile, Miu's come of the age when she's noticing boys and this shy young lady has noticed the handsome Kazuya Takahashi—even if he hasn't noticed her.This is Miu's story. The story of a young girl who is on a journey to discover the melody within her own heart and the courage to express it.(Source: RightStuf)"	['Side story: Piano (TV) Specials']	['Nomura, Miu', 'Nomura, Akiko', 'Nomura, Seiji', 'Shirakawa-sensei', 'Nomura, Hitomi', 'Takahashi, Kazuya', 'Takizawa', 'Matsubara, Yuuki']	['Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Neya, Michiko', 'Ootsuka, Akio', 'Miyamoto, Mitsuru', 'Sasaki, Yuko', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Hoshi, Souichirou', 'Kawakami, Tomoko']	[['Yamada, Yuuko', 'Producer'], ['Watanabe, Jun', 'Sound Director'], ['Egami, Kiyoshi', 'Episode Director'], ['Kimiya, Shigeru', 'Episode Director']]
