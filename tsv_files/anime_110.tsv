All assigned to the same cell, they meet older inmate Rokurouta Sakuragi—a former boxer—with whom they establish a close bond. Under his guidance, and with the promise that they will meet again on the outside after serving their sentences, the delinquents begin to view their hopeless situation in a better light.Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin follows the seven cellmates as they struggle together against the brutal suffering and humiliation inflicted upon them by Ishihara, a sadistic guard with a grudge on Rokurouta, and Gisuke Sasaki, a doctor who takes pleasure in violating boys. Facing such hellish conditions, the seven inmates must scrape together all the strength they have to survive until their sentences are up; but even if they do, just what kind of lives are waiting for them on the other side?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin']	['Sakuragi, Rokurouta', 'Minakami, Mario', 'Maeda, Noboru', 'Yokosuka, Jou', 'Nomoto, Ryuuji', 'Tooyama, Tadayoshi', 'Matsuura, Mansaku', 'Ishihara', 'Koike, Setsuko', 'Lilly']	['Koyama, Rikiya', 'Oguri, Shun', 'Park, Romi', 'Hasome, Tatsuya', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Kuroda, Takaya', 'Waki, Tomohiro', 'Ishii, Kouji', 'Kanjiya, Shihori', 'Yamagata, Kaori']	[['Koujina, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Yajima, Tetsuo', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Tanaka, Tomoya', 'Episode Director']]
