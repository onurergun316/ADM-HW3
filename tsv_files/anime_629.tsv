Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt	ONA	4	12/25/2015	12/25/2015	44627	7.94	22048	629	2662	In Universal Century 0079, forces of the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon engage in a battle within the Thunderbolt Sector during the One Year War. This section of space—known for its constant strikes of electricity—proves to be a deadly battlefield, as Federation pilot Io Fleming leads a charge against Zeon's ace Daryl Lorenz and his squad of snipers. With the fighters on both sides proving to be formidable soldiers, neither side is willing to back down, fighting strategically amongst the remnants of colonies.But when Io gets a hold of a prototype Gundam, Daryl will have to make a sacrifice in order to obtain enough power to crush his enemy and ensure that Zeon is victorious, or watch as his comrades are slaughtered by a single man.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kidou Senshi Gundam Thunderbolt', 'Parent story: Mobile Suit Gundam', 'Alternative version: Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: December Sky', 'Sequel: Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt 2nd Season']	['Fleming, Io', 'Lorenz, Daryl', 'Sexton, J.
