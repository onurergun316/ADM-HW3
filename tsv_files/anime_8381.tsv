Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more... What should Alice do in such a world!?(Source: MU)	['Adaptation: Heart no Kuni no Alice: Wonderful Wonder World']	['Dupre, Blood', 'White, Peter', 'Ace', 'Liddell, Alice', 'Airay, Boris', 'Monrey, Julius', 'March, Elliot', 'Tweedle Dum', 'Tweedle Dee', 'Vivaldi']	['Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Miyata, Kouki', 'Hirakawa, Daisuke', 'Kugimiya, Rie', 'Sugiyama, Noriaki', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Mogami, Tsuguo', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Kaida, Yuuko']	[['Ooba, Hideaki', 'Director'], ['QuinRose', 'Theme Song Performance, Original Creator'], ['Hirasawa, Akihiro', 'Background Art'], ['Hara, Shuuichi', 'Character Design']]
