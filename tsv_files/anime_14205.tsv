The mother sang a song that described what a wolf looks like, and mimicked a wolf. The little replied, ""I know, I know,"" despite having never seen a wolf before. The story follows the little rabbit encountering other animals and judging them to be a wolf or not by comparing them to the description from the song."	 	[]	[]
