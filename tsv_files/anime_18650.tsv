Following his untimely end, he finds himself in a surprisingly familiar roomâ€”a setting of the game where Evelogia exists. Although the revelation delights him, disappointment creeps in as Toshiaki realizes that he is the character who is destined to assassinate the great demon king.However, Toshiaki rejects his role and instead allies himself with Evelogia. Now with someone trustworthy by his side for the first time ever, Evelogia is emotional. But living regular lives proves to be challenging for both of them; Evelogia wields uncontrollable destructive power while Toshiaki grows dangerously obsessed with the antagonist.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Maou Evelogia ni Mi wo Sasage yo']	['Evelogia', 'Gozu, Toshiaki', 'Makidi', 'Tishia']	['Horie, Shun', 'Satou, Takuya', 'Yasumoto, Hiroki', 'Nabatame, Hitomi']	[['Satou, Takuya', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Horie, Shun', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Kajiwara, Io', 'Original Creator']]
