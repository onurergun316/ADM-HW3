Aiseki Mogol Girl	TV	12	10/03/2017	10/03/2017	408		0	14764	13501	"The series features colorful stop-motion mascot characters made out of pipe cleaners. In Japanese, ""aiseki"" refers to the situation of sharing a table at a restaurant with a person you don't know. The show is surreal datsuryoku-kei comedy with a variety of male guest voice actors who banter with Fuyumi and Haruko at a table in the Mongol Cafe."
