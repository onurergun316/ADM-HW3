Retreating into the world of VR, her virtual boyfriend showers her with praise and shows up in cute outfits, albeit for a price.While scrambling to find other ways to earn money, Retsuko finds herself in yet another financial bind after accidentally ramming into a parked van with a rental vehicle. The owner of the van, a gruff cheetah named Hyoudou, recruits her as an accountant for an underground idol group which he manages. Retsuko soon begins to buckle under the pressure from the new job, leading to plenty of inspiration for her next death metal vent sessions.In the midst of it all, Retsuko begins to wonder if she truly desires a colorless and uninteresting life, or if there's something waiting beyond her office desk. Will Retsuko finally come out on top, both in love and in the workplace? Or will she once again be convinced that the dull and sterile life in her office environment is the one she must lead?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Alternative version: Aggressive Retsuko', 'Prequel: Aggressive Retsuko (ONA) 2nd Season', 'Character: OTMGirls no Yokiyoki Channel', 'Sequel: Aggressive Retsuko (ONA) 4th Season']	"['Retsuko', 'Hyoudou', 'Haida', 'Fenneko', 'Tadano', 'Washimi', 'Buchou, Gori', 'Inui', 'Manaka', ""Retsuko's Mother""]"	['Kaolip', 'Arai, Souta', 'Katou, Shingo', 'Inoue, Rina', 'Inoue, Rina', 'Watabe, Sayumi']	[['Percy, Xavier', 'ADR Director']]
