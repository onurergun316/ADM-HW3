His monotonous life is interrupted when the peculiar Haru Nonaka makes a lively appearance, frequently dropping by his workplace to befriend him. When Rikuo learns that an old college friend and crush, Shinako Morinome, has moved back into town, he reaches out to further their relationship. Unbeknownst to Rikuo however, Shinako is carrying painful memories from her past that were holding her back from accepting his feelings. Meanwhile, as Haru continually opens up to Rikuo, he discovers that she, much like him, is living by herself and wants to step out of her comfort zone into an uncertain future.The past lingers long in the mind, and the future remains elusive. At a crossroads along their intertwined paths, these three experience what it means to let go of their feelings of yesterday and embrace the change that tomorrow brings.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Yesterday wo Utatte', 'Side story: Yesterday wo Utatte: Haishin-ban Episode']	['Morinome, Shinako', 'Nonaka, Haru', 'Uozumi, Rikuo', 'Yuzuhara, Chika', 'Kansuke', 'Minato, Kouichi', 'Kinoshita', 'Hayakawa, Rou', 'Sayama, Kyouko', 'Fukuda, Takanori']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Miyamoto, Yume', 'Kobayashi, Chikahiro', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Maekawa, Ryouko', 'Ono, Yuuki', 'Suzuki, Tatsuhisa', 'Hanae, Natsuki', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Terashima, Takuma']	[['Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki', 'Director, Script, Series Composition'], ['Tsuchiya, Masaki', 'Sound Director'], ['Tanaka, Jin', 'Script'], ['Sayuri', 'Theme Song Performance']]
