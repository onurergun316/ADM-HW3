Jagainu-kun	TV	26	04/04/2004	04/04/2004	1346	6.44	547	6456	10405	Known in Japan as Jagainu-kun, Dogtato is the heartwarming tale of a dog that`s really a potato...or a potato that`s really a dog. Or something. (Jagaimo = potato, inu = dog, thus the name Jagainu/Dogtato.) Dogtato`s world is full of his lovable half-veggie, half-animal friends who are always getting into wacky hijinks and misadventures.(Source: AniDB)	 	['Haripoteto', 'Jagainu']	['Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Adachi, Shinobu']	[['Kagawa, Yutaka', 'Director'], ['Itou, Ikuko', 'Character Design']]
