Maku	Movie	1	08/25/2014	-	372	5.58	129	10135	13833	"""There are two people who face each other in each space. Each pair keeps a few distance between their partners and find some fearful, tender, and comfortable feelings that fascinate them. The feelings are put into practice immediately, and they start groping each feelings. Somehow, I try to blend and connect them. ""Feelings"" are sound bliss for all who have a body and sense. I busily pick my feelings on the track of my life and reconstruct by animation to appreciate them.""(Source: Yoriko Mizushiri)"	...	[]	[]	NA
