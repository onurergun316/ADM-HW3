The village's water priestess, Kirara, her younger sister, Komachi, and a heartbroken villager, Rikichi, set off to hire willing samurai with nothing to offer but rice from their meager harvests. Through dangerous encounters and a bit of luck, seven samurai of varying specialties and experience are gathered for an epic battle against the bandits and the merchants that influence them.Samurai 7 is based loosely upon Kurosawa Akira's famous movie ""Seven Samurai""/""Shichinin no Samurai"""	['Adaptation: Samurai 7']	['Kyuzo', 'Kikuchiyo', 'Hayashida, Heihachi', 'Shimada, Kambei', 'Okamoto, Katsushiro', 'Kirara', 'Katayama, Gorobei', 'Komachi', 'Shichiroji', 'Rikichi']	['Miki, Shinichiro', 'Kong, Kuwata', 'Inukai, Junji', 'Terasoma, Masaki', 'Park, Romi', 'Orikasa, Fumiko', 'Inada, Tetsu', 'Saitou, Chiwa', 'Kusano, Tooru', 'Saizen, Tadahisa']	[['Watson, Barry', 'Producer'], ['Takizawa, Toshifumi', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Tada, Shunsuke', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
