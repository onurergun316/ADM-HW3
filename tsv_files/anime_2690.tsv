In the present day, the nefarious organization Demon Card seeks the Dark Brings' power for their all but innocent intentions. Haru Glory, a sword-wielding silver-haired teenager, inherits the title of Rave Master: the person who wields the power of the legendary Rave Stones, artifacts capable of destroying the Dark Brings. However, the many Rave Stones were scattered across the globe as a result of the Overdrive, allowing Demon Card to continue their malpractices. Groove Adventure Rave follows Haru, his strange dog Plue, the fiery blonde Ellie, and the infamous thief Musica, as they embark on a great journey that will take them around the vast world, searching for the Rave Stones that will finally end Demon Card's injustice.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Rave', 'Character: Fairy Tail', 'Spin-off: Fairy Tail x Rave']	['Glory, Haru', 'Plue', 'Elie', 'Musica, Hamrio', 'Kato, Griffon', 'Sieghart', 'Let Dahaka, Java', 'Reina', 'Shuda', 'Ruby']	['Seki, Tomokazu', 'Suzuki, Akiko', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Morikubo, Shoutarou', 'Shiga, Katsuya', 'Kikuchi, Masami', 'Murozono, Takehiro', 'Yukana', 'Seki, Toshihiko', 'Suzuki, Akiko']	[['Watanabe, Takashi', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Matsushima, Akira', 'Episode Director, Animation Director, Character Design'], ['Fukazawa, Manabu', 'Episode Director, Animation Director'], ['Matsuoka, Hideaki', 'Episode Director, Animation Director']]
