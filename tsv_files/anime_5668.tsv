Hanaukyou Maid-tai	TV	12	04/12/2001	04/12/2001	28614	6.59	12226	5671	3359	After losing his mother, 14-year-old Taro journeys to Tokyo to live with his grandfather. But he gets the biggest surprise when he discovers that his grandfather's home is a huge mansion with hundreds of beautiful maids ready to serve him. Making matters worse (at least for Taro, but not for our viewing) is that not only does he inherit the Hanaukyo mansion, he gets the services of all of the maids 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Hanaukyou Maid-tai', 'Alternative version: Hanaukyou Maid-tai: La Verite', 'Sequel: Hanaukyou Maid-tai OVA']	['Mariel', 'Hanaukyou, Tarou', 'Ichigo, Sango and Ringo', 'Tsurugi, Konoe', 'Landlavizar, Cynthia', 'Suzuki, Ikuyo', 'Jihiyou, Ryuuka', 'Grace']	['Tanaka, Rie', 'Kaida, Yuki', 'Hiramatsu, Akiko', 'Kaneda, Tomoko', 'Arishima, Moyu', 'Takahashi, Rieko', 'Kaneda, Tomoko']	[['Ide, Yasunori', 'Director, Series Composition'], ['Matsuoka, Hiroki', 'Sound Director'], ['Kuzuya, Naoyuki', 'Episode Director'], ['Nonaka, Takuya', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
