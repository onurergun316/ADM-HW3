One Room	TV	12	01/11/2017	01/11/2017	105871	5.56	38981	10191	1556	Having just moved into a new apartment building, Yui Hanasaka makes a customary visit to greet her neighbor. When she learns that he is an upperclassman at the university she aspires to attend, she asks for his help to pass her entrance exams. Meanwhile, Natsuki Momohara decides to visit her older brother, who lives alone in an apartment in Tokyo. Elsewhere, aspiring singer Moka Aoshima reunites with her childhood friend, who is a hopeful novelist. Three stories, although seemingly unrelated, contain the same essence: strings of fate will bind together those who share the same destiny, and one needs to look no further than a single apartment room.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Other: Room Mate', 'Side story: One Room Special', 'Sequel: One Room Second Season', 'Summary: One Room Second Season: Hanasaka Yui no Prologue']	['Hanasaka, Yui', 'Momohara, Natsuki', 'Aoshima, Moka']	['Ichimichi, Mao', 'Murakawa, Rie', 'Mimori, Suzuko']	[['Shimoi, Aose', 'Script'], ['Mimori, Suzuko', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Ichimichi, Mao', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Murakawa, Rie', 'Theme Song Performance']]
