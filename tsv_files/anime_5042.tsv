The leaders of idol groups SolidS, SOARA, QUELL, and Growth must compose four unique and distinctive songs for their respective units, which they will perform on the second day of the festival.Composing four new songs proves to be a difficult task for SolidS's leader, Shiki Takamura, as he struggles to find inspiration.

Wanting to escape his past stardom, Shuu Izumi is determined to push his unit, QUELL, up to the level of popularity that his previous one had.
