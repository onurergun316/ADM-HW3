Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Waga Yuku wa Hoshi no Taikai	Movie	1	02/06/1988	-	33188	7.92	18902	655	3131	Four months before Count von Lohengramm of the Galactic Empire faced Yang Wen-li of the Free Planets Alliance at the Battle of Astarte, he was still just Reinhard von Müsel. The youngest admiral in the Empire's history, Reinhard was disdained and dismissed by his peers as the brother of the Kaiser's concubine. Upon arriving at Iserlohn Fortress with his expeditionary fleet, Reinhard immediately receives an order from the ambitious and cunning Fleet Admiral Gregor von Mückenberger: to intercept an Alliance fleet in a neighboring starzone. Despite recognizing this as a veiled attempt to get him killed in combat, Reinhard nevertheless orders his tired and weary men to engage the enemy in the atmosphere of the gas giant Legnica. But unbeknownst to him, this will mark the first of his many historic encounters with the Hero of El Facil.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Prequel: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden: Ougon no Tsubasa', 'Sequel: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Arata Naru Tatakai no Overture']	['Yang, Wen-li', 'von Lohengramm, Reinhard', 'Kircheis, Siegfried', 'Attenborough, Dusty', 'von Reuenthal, Oskar', 'von Oberstein, Paul', 'Mittermeyer, Wolfgang', 'Poplan, Olivier', 'Mecklinger, Ernest', 'Narrator']	['Tomiyama, Kei', 'Horikawa, Ryo', 'Hironaka, Masashi', 'Inoue, Kazuhiko', 'Wakamoto, Norio', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Mori, Katsuji', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Hashi, Takaya', 'Yara, Yuusaku']	[['Ishiguro, Noboru', 'Director'], ['Aketagawa, Susumu', 'Sound Director'], ['Kawajiri, Yoshiaki', 'Script'], ['Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus', 'Music']]
