Now he has to find a place of his own, but unlike other dragons, Letty is meek, cowardly, and has overall low stats. Regardless, a defenseless young dragon makes for an easy target for those who only see him as a beast to be feared, vanquished, and even devoured. After some time searching for somewhere to call ""home,"" he encounters the elf Dearia, who saves him from a band of heroes. Both an architect and a real estate agent, Dearia offers to help Letty find the perfect abode that suits his needs. Thus ensues Letty's house-hunting quest, as well as all the fantastical creatures and formidable enemies he meets along the way![Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Dragon, Ie wo Kau.']	['Dearia', 'Letty', 'Piyobelt', 'Nell', 'Huey', 'Narrator', 'Albert', 'Shiro Madoushi', 'Yuusha', 'Thief']	['Ishikawa, Kaito', 'Horie, Shun', 'Izawa, Shiori', 'Fukuen, Misato', 'Kondou, Takashi', 'Morimoto, Leo', 'Ichimichi, Mao', 'Hirakawa, Daisuke', 'Itou, Kento', 'Takahashi, Chiaki']	[['Kasugamori, Haruki', 'Director'], ['Ooishi, Masayoshi', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Morishita, Katsuji', 'Planning'], ['Yamamoto, Sei', 'Director of Photography']]
