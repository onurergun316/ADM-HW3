Equipped with a wooden katana and feisty personality, Taiga is known throughout the school as the ""Palmtop Tiger.""One day, an embarrassing mistake causes the two students to cross paths. Ryuuji discovers that Taiga actually has a sweet side: she has a crush on the popular vice president, Yuusaku Kitamura, who happens to be his best friend. But things only get crazier when Ryuuji reveals that he has a crush on Minori Kushiedaâ€”Taiga's best friend!Toradora! is a romantic comedy that follows this odd duo as they embark on a quest to help each other with their respective crushes, forming an unlikely alliance in the process.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Toradora!', 'Side story: Toradora!: SOS!
