While shocked, Remu is supportive of his sister's decision, until the disaster known as the ""Early Rapture"" happens.The Early Rapture causes everyone who has uploaded their consciousnesses to either fall into a coma or perish. Remu visits his sister's empty apartment one last time, but is shocked when Shiki arrives at the door.
