Kariage-kun	TV	59	10/17/1989	10/17/1989	351		0	16624	14003	"Based on the same name yonkoma manga by Ueda Masashi, serialized in Weekly Manga Action.From putting his head of department to embarrasment by announcing to everyone that he has haemmorrhoids through the PA system in a public park to making a whole district dissapointed by putting a notice that there will be a fireworks display, and apparently the only ""display"" is him holding one small fireworks, Kariage-kun tells the amusing everyday life of, well, Kariage-kun. His typical victim is his head of department, although anyone (or anything) can become a prey to his irony or sarcasm. The story began and ended with no special beginning or endings, but it is arranged chronologically (in the sense that it follows seasonal changes).(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Kariage-kun']	['Kariage, Shota', 'President Kinoshita']	['Shioya, Yoku', 'Yanami, Jouji']	[['Shibata, Hiroki', 'Director, Episode Director'], ['Yamayoshi, Yasuo', 'Episode Director'], ['Sumisawa, Katsuyuki', 'Script'], ['Hoshiyama, Hiroyuki', 'Script']]
