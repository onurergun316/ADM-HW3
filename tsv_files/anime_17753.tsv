He was told to become independent, but he couldn't find a suitable place to live by himself. His childhood friend Shiori couldn't stand watching him in his current state and suggested that he live with her. While he thought that it wouldn't really make him independent, his parents readily agreed to the idea. Before he knew it, they were living together under the same roof.Their cohabitation was only to last one month. Since it's only for a short period and she's his childhood friend, he thought that nothing wrong will happen. However, living together with Shiori revealed to him aside which he hadn't seen before, and he began to see her as a woman. Where will their relationship end up now that he had begun to have feelings for her?(Source: vndb)	['Other: Aibeya The Animation']	['Takanashi, Shiori', 'Sunohara, Nozomu']	[]	[['Horikawa, Kazuto', 'Editing, Director of Photography']]
