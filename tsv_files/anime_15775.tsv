The recaps aired on the exact day as their 1st episodes of the seasons of the previous year (albeit the seasons are 12 eps long even though there is no break in airing and the ep count continues like normal and the show is a monthly release). The recaps are done in a variety show style where the GJ8man main cast watches clips of the show and gives commentary.	['Full story: GJ8man']
