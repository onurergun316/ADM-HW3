Urusei Yatsura Movie 1: Only You	Movie	1	02/13/1983	-	8322	7.07	3913	3467	5717	"Lum doesn't need much assistance going ballistic when everyone in Tomobiki gets an invitation to Ataru's wedding -- and she's not listed as the bride! It seems that some 11 years ago, Ataru played ""Shadow Tag"" with a young girl named Elle and won. Unfortunately, Elle was yet another Alien Princess; and on her planet, if a boy steps on a girl's shadow, they have to marry. When Elle's emissary comes to make arrangements, Lum redefines the term ""the atmosphere was electric,"" but to no avail: a force-field now protects Ataru from her high voltage love-zaps. Lum's friend Benten suggests a pre-emptive wedding, and they proceed to abduct Ataru and all of the wedding guests, and the stage is set for the shotgun wedding of all time!(Source: AniDB)"	['Parent story: Urusei Yatsura']	['Lum', 'Moroboshi, Ataru', 'Mendo, Shutaro', 'de Rosenbach, Elle', 'Ran', 'Sakuranbou', 'Miyake, Shinobu', 'Satoshi', 'Sakura', 'Ten']	['Hirano, Fumi', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Kamiya, Akira', 'Sakakibara, Yoshiko', 'Inoue, You', 'Nagai, Ichiro', 'Shimazu, Saeko', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Washio, Machiko', 'Sugiyama, Kazuko']	[['Oshii, Mamoru', 'Director'], ['Annou, Takashi', 'Episode Director'], ['Ito, Kazunori', 'Script'], ['Takahashi, Rumiko', 'Original Creator']]
