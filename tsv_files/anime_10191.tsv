Pony Metal U-GAIM Promotion Film	Special	1	01/01/1986	-	890	5.56	385	10194	11436	This is a short little pilot film inserting Yuu Morisawa, the heroine of Creamy Mami, into the mecha world of Heavy Metal L-Gaim. After Yuu Morisawa is killed in a car accident, she is rebuilt as Pony Metal U-GAIM in a scenario Ã  la Astroboy. Put to a high-energy Japanese pop song, this experimental mishmash of genres was the brainchild of studio Anime R. The series was never made for copyright reasons, and this pilot film is all that remains alongside a handful of merchandise.
