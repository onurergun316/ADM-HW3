Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou	TV	12	04/04/2014	04/04/2014	337237	7.69	170398	1085	501	Kazunari Usa is a high school freshman who will start living alone due to his parents now working in a different area. Excited for his new independent life, he hopes to go about his teenage days without the worry of dealing with any strange people, but as he soon discovers, his new boarding house Kawai Complex is far from ordinary.The various tenants at Kawai Complex are all quite eccentric characters. Shirosaki, Kazunari's roommate, is a pervert and masochist; Mayumi Nishikino, a borderline alcoholic office lady, hates couples because of her unfortunate luck with men; and Sayaka Watanabe, a seemingly innocent college student, enjoys leading men on. Shocked with the lack of decent individuals at his new residence, Kazunari is about to leave when he runs into shy senior student Ritsu Kawai and finds himself slowly falling in love with her.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou', 'Side story: Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou: Hajimete no', 'Other: Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou Specials']	['Kawai, Ritsu', 'Usa, Kazunari', 'Shirosaki, Shizuru', 'Nishikino, Mayumi', 'Watanabe, Sayaka', 'Kawai, Sumiko', 'Tsuneda, Miharu', 'Usa, Mother', 'Tagami', 'Hayashi']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Iguchi, Yuuichi', 'Shinomiya, Gou', 'Satou, Rina', 'Kanemoto, Hisako', 'Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Suwa, Ayaka', 'Taguchi, Hiroko', 'Sakai, Shunsuke', 'Numakura, Manami']	[['Miya, Shigeyuki', 'Director'], ['Kawazoe, Kengo', 'Sound Director'], ['Koga, Kazuomi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Nakano, Hideaki', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
