Their members consist of the always energetic Kyouko Toshinou; calm and sensible Yui Funami; polite but often overlooked Akari Akaza; and Chinatsu Yoshikawa, who stumbled upon the others while looking for the Tea Ceremony Club. Together they are the Amusement Club, which has the deceptively simple task of keeping its members entertained.Along with the Student Council and the odd family member, they strive to enjoy their youth to the fullest. Whether it's a trip to a hot spring or finishing overdue homework, their lives are never dull, and they will always find an excuse to spend time together.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Yuru Yuri', 'Prequel: Yuru Yuri', 'Sequel: Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi!']	['Toshinou, Kyouko', 'Akaza, Akari', 'Funami, Yui', 'Yoshikawa, Chinatsu', 'Sugiura, Ayano', 'Oomuro, Sakurako', 'Ikeda, Chitose', 'Furutani, Himawari', 'Matsumoto, Rise', 'Akaza, Akane']	['Ootsubo, Yuka', 'Mikami, Shiori', 'Tsuda, Minami', 'Ookubo, Rumi', 'Fujita, Saki', 'Katou, Emiri', 'Toyosaki, Aki', 'Mimori, Suzuko', 'Gotou, Saori', 'Horie, Yui']	[['Oota, Masahiko', 'Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Ebina, Yasunori', 'Sound Director'], ['Nakanishi, Nobuaki', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Aoshima, Takashi', 'Script']]
