Orenchi no Furo Jijou	TV	13	10/06/2014	10/06/2014	97410	6.98	49203	3870	1674	On his way home from school, Tatsumi sees a man collapsed near a lake. When he approaches him, Tatsumi notices something strange: the person in need of help is actually a beautiful merman named Wakasa! Because Wakasa's home has become too polluted to live in, Tatsumi graciously offers his bathtub as a refuge.With a boisterous merman as his new roommate, Tatsumi's normal life won't be returning anytime soon, not to mention Wakasa's aquatic friends—Takasu, Mikuni, and Maki—often show up uninvited, making them all quite a handful for the high school student. As he humors their curiosity for human life, Tatsumi sometimes finds himself enjoying their childish antics, but he will have to keep his cool if he intends to keep up with his daily life and newfound friendship.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Orenchi no Furo Jijou']	['Wakasa', 'Tatsumi', 'Maki', 'Takasu', 'Mikuni', 'Narrator', 'Kasumi']	['Umehara, Yuuichirou', 'Shimazaki, Nobunaga', 'Tsuda, Kenjirou', 'Suzuki, Tatsuhisa', 'Hanae, Natsuki', 'Kawahara, Yoshihisa', 'Kido, Ibuki']	[['Aoi, Sayo', 'Director, Episode Director'], ['Ayana, Yuniko', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Matenrou Opera', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Itou, Naoyuki', 'Key Animation']]
