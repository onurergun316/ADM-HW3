New Dominion Tank Police	OVA	6	10/20/1993	10/20/1993	9375	6.92	4079	4107	5441	In the follow up to Shirow's classic anime, Al, Leona and their trusty steed, Bonaparte, continue to fight crime in New Port City, alongside the rest of the Tank Police. But a new threat appears in the form of a series of terrorist attacks, using the latest weapons technology. The Tank Police are out-numbered and out-gunned, but Al and Leona set out to discover who or what is behind these attacks. With massive explosions and high-speed chases, Leona often causes more damage than the criminals she pursues.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Dominion', 'Prequel: Dominion', 'Sequel: TANK S.W.A.T. 01']	['Ozaki, Leona', 'Annapuma', 'Brenten, Charles', 'Unipuma', 'MÃ¼ller, Vittorio', 'Megane', 'Shinpu', 'Alc Ad Solte']	['Sakuma, Rei', 'Hisakawa, Aya', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Kumagaya, Nina', 'Wakamoto, Norio', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Yanada, Kiyoyuki', 'Shibamoto, Hiroyuki']	[['Furuse, Noboru', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Yamaguchi, Hiroshi', 'Script'], ['Shirow, Masamune', 'Original Creator'], ['Nakazawa, Kazuto', 'Animation Director']]
