PES: Peace Eco Smile	ONA	7	05/25/2012	05/25/2012	3370	5.62	1655	10013	8098	A collaborative effort between the Japanese automaker and Japanese anime company Studio 4Â°C, PES: Peace Eco Smile is a new web promotional anime series that centers around PES, a traveller from space, and NaSuBi, a mysterious life-form who is enamored by the charm of Earth. The car of choice for these strangers in a new world? The Prius, particularly the Prius Liftback and Prius C hatchback. These two hybrids seem to be as much a part of this series as the two main characters are. A Lexus LFA (likely the ride of the antagonist) and the Toyota Camry hybrid also have a role to play.Each anime short in the campaign will be three to four minutes long and will be posted on Toyota's specially-dedicated website.(Source: Auto Tribute)	['Spin-off: PES: Peace Eco Smile - Drive your Heart']	['Pes', 'Kurumi', 'Sho', 'NaSuBi', 'Ken']	['Kokubun, Masato', 'Uchiyama, Yumi', 'Yajima, Akiko', 'Kako, Lion']	[['Tanaka, Eiko', 'Producer'], ['Hayashi, Yuuichirou', 'Director, Key Animation'], ['Watanbe, Shunsuke', 'Episode Director']]
