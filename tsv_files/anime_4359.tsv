In his attempts to cheer her up, her father brings home a large, striped egg, which he hopes will successfully hatch (unexpectedly into a green dinosaur whom they call ""Muka-Muka,"" which are the only words which the baby reptile can speak). Muka-Muka soon becomes the talk of the town and comes into the interest of the town's professor and his wacky inventions, including a time machine which successfully teleports the Shikatani's among other families and their homes to pre-historic times where they encounter several other dinosaurs and enchanted beings on their adventures.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Muka Muka Paradise']	['Muka Muka', 'Shikatani, Uiba']	['Sakamoto, Chika', 'Watanabe, Kumiko']	[['Yatabe, Katsuyoshi', 'Director'], ['Hayase, Hiroyuki', 'Sound Director'], ['Watanabe, Akio', 'Key Animation, Animation Director'], ['Igarashi, Yumiko', 'Original Character Design']]
