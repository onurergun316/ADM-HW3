Kodoku no Gourmet	ONA	10	11/29/2017	11/29/2017	879		0	16825	11496	Inogashira Gorou eats and indulges at restaurants or ramen shops found on any street corners. He has become a liberal foodie removed from social obligations for a fleeting moment to satisfy his hunger. Solitary Gourmet... That's the solitary process of eating without interruption or worry that gives the most comfort to people equally.(Source: Jmanga)	['Adaptation: Kodoku no Gourmet']	['Inogashira, Gorou']	['Horiuchi, Kenyuu']	[['Kise, Kazuchika', 'Director'], ['Taniguchi, Jiro', 'Original Character Design'], ['Kusumi, Masayuki', 'Original Creator']]
