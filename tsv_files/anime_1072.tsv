Unfortunately, his peaceful life is destroyed when war breaks out between the Katjvarna Empire and the neighboring Republic of Kioka. Ikta and his childhood friend, Yatorishino Igsem, join the army as military officers, where they meet the infantryman Matthew Tetojirichi, the sniper Torway Remion, and the medic Haroma Becker on a boat heading for the military exam site.However, after a rogue storm sinks their vessel, the five of them end up in enemy territory near a military outpost. There, they discover that the heir to the Katjvarnan throne, Princess Chamille Kitora Katjvanmaninik, has been taken hostage. The five are able to rescue her, and as a reward, each one of them is granted the title of Imperial Knightâ€”one of the highest honors a soldier can receive. It seems that Ikta will have to put his dream of tranquility on hold, as he must now become the hero he never wanted to be.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin']	['Solork, Ikta', 'Kitora Katjvanmaninik, Chamille', 'Igsem, Yatorishino', 'Tetojirichi, Matthew', 'Becker, Haroma', 'Remion, Torway', 'Temari, Kanna', 'Dal, Nanaqu', 'Arquinex, Jean', 'Shia']	['Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Minase, Inori', 'Taneda, Risa', 'Majima, Junji', 'Chisuga, Haruka', 'Kanemoto, Ryousuke', 'Hayama, Ikumi', 'Takahashi, Rie', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Yamazaki, Haruka']	[['Nakayama, Nobuhiro', 'Producer'], ['Ichimura, Tetsuo', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Yabuta, Shuuhei', 'Episode Director']]
