Fate has returned to Uminari City with Lindy as her legal guardian and is living the life of a normal elementary schoolgirl along with Nanoha and her friends. The reunion between the two new-found friends is cut short, however, when they are assaulted by four ancient magic users who identify themselves as the Wolkenritter. As the motives behind the actions of the Wolkenritter become clear, Nanoha and Fate find themselves in a race against time to stop the reactivation of a highly dangerous artifact known as The Book of Darkness.(Source: ANN)	"[""Adaptation: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's - Tribute Comics"", ""Alternative version: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's"", 'Prequel: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st', 'Sequel: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Reflection', ""Side story: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 2nd A's Mini Picture Drama"", ""Other: Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's Picture Drama""]"	['Testarossa, Fate', 'Takamachi, Nanoha', 'Yagami, Hayate', 'Vita', 'Signum', 'Shamal', 'Zafila', 'Reinforce I', 'Reinforce II', 'Scrya, Yuuno']	['Mizuki, Nana', 'Tamura, Yukari', 'Ueda, Kana', 'Sanada, Asami', 'Shimizu, Kaori', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka', 'Ichijo, Kazuya', 'Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Yukana', 'Mizuhashi, Kaori']	[['Kusakawa, Keizou', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Natsume, Kouichirou', 'Episode Director'], ['Abe, Nozomu', 'Storyboard']]
