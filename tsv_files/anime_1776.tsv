Unfortunately, these gifts have been nothing but nightmares. As a result, when his father sends him a huge package from Egypt, Sora prepares himself for the worst, only to be greeted by Mii-kunâ€”a cute, pint-sized mummy! While initially wary, Sora soon learns that Mii-kun is harmless, a delicate creature yearning for attention.Throughout their amusing day-to-day lives, the unlikely pair meet other people with unique pets, while also strengthening their bond together. Although keeping a pet is a difficult task, Sora is set on caring for the lovable Mii-kun.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Miira no Kaikata']	['Mii-kun', 'Kashiwagi, Sora', 'Kamiya, Tazuki', 'Conny', 'Isao', 'Mukumuku', 'Motegi, Asa', 'Kashiwagi, Kaede', 'Tachiaki, Daichi', 'Kashiwagi, Mokuren']	['Kayano, Ai', 'Tamura, Mutsumi', 'Koumoto, Keisuke', 'Kayano, Ai', 'Yamashita, Seiichirou', 'Akaneya, Himika', 'Kayano, Ai', 'Yamashita, Seiichirou', 'Matsuyama, Takashi']	[['Nasuda, Atsushi', 'Producer'], ['Kaori', 'Director'], ['Kameyama, Toshiki', 'Sound Director'], ['Tsuri Bit', 'Theme Song Performance']]
