However, Nanako is no ordinary girl, as she cannot speak! Instead, Nanako communicates through senryuuâ€”17-syllable-long poems. Sixteen-year-old Eiji Busujima used to be delinquent in his middle school years. However, he has since turned over a new leaf due to his newfound love of senryuu. Despite his menacing looks, Eiji gets along well with Nanako as a fellow member of the Literature Club.Even though Nanako is mute, the adorable pair have no problem communicating with each other. Senryuu Shoujo is a light and relaxing story of two teenagers' daily lives.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Senryuu Shoujo']	['Yukishiro, Nanako', 'Busujima, Eiji', 'Katagiri, Amane', 'Yakobe, Kino', 'Hanakai, Tao', 'Ootsuki, Koto', 'Yukishiro, Yoshihiko', 'Busujima, Akira']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Hatanaka, Tasuku', 'Yahagi, Sayuri', 'Kuno, Misaki', 'Uesaka, Sumire', 'Aida, Rikako', 'Iwata, Mitsuo']	[['Jinbo, Masato', 'Director, Series Composition'], ['Tsuchiya, Masaki', 'Sound Director'], ['Aida, Rikako', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Tateyama, Akiyuki', 'Music']]
