Stuck living with her working mother Nobuko, NEET brother Tsubasa, laid-off father Takafumi, and single-parent sister Sanae, the only hope for this family to raise a decent adult is her little nephew Makoto. However, this struggling family's life takes a turn for the worse when Makoto and Tsubasa are violently kidnapped by a mysterious organization and held for ransom. With only 30 minutes to deliver five million yen to the criminals, Juri's grandfather reveals a dangerously powerful secret to her and Takafumi.By offering blood to her grandfather's mystical stone, the three enter the world of ""Stasis,"" a version of their world where time stops for everyone but the users. Having arrived at their destination, their rescue efforts go awry when they are assailed by a surprising group of people who are somehow able to move around within Stasis. While all hope seems lost, a monstrous giant known as the Herald appears amidst the chaos, its intent and motivations as cryptic as the very nature of this timeless world.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Kokkoku']	['Yukawa, Juri', 'Jiisan', 'Yukawa, Makoto', 'Majima, Shouko', 'Sagawa, Junji', 'Shiomi', 'Sako', 'Yukawa, Sanae', 'Yukawa, Tsubasa', 'Yukawa, Takafumi']	['Anzai, Chika', 'Yamaji, Kazuhiro', 'Iwata, Ryuuto', 'Seto, Asami', 'Gouda, Hozumi', 'Uchida, Yuuya', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Nojima, Hirofumi', 'Tsujitani, Kouji']	[['Kimura, Makoto', 'Producer'], ['Oohashi, Yoshimitsu', 'Director'], ['Fujita, Akiko', 'Sound Director'], ['Suganuma, Eiji', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Setting, Animation Director, Key Animation']]
