Although his mother is allergic to cats and has a great fear of them, she agrees to let him keep the kitten because she fears he is becoming too withdrawn after failing his university entrance exams. Chibi-neko soon falls in love with Tokio.In her own mind, Chibi-neko is a small human who speaks in human words, although people only ever seem to hear her meow, and she believes that all humans were once kittens like her. A stray cat tells Chibi-neko of a paradise called Cottonland, where dreams can come true.(Source: Wikipedia)	['Adaptation: Wata no Kuni Hoshi', 'Alternative version: Wata no Kuni Hoshi Pilot']	['Chibi-neko', 'Suwano, Tokio', 'Raphael', 'Neko Mania', 'Mitsuko', 'Suwano, Fumiko', 'Suzuki, Buchi-neko', 'Suwano, Tobio']	['Tominaga, Miina', 'Shimada, Bin', 'Nozawa, Nachi', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Han, Keiko', 'Ueda, Miyuki', 'Nagahisa, Isao', 'Hazama, Michio']	[['Matsuura, Noriyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Ooshima, Yumiko', 'Script, Theme Song Lyrics, Original Creator'], ['Tsuji, Masaki', 'Script'], ['Hagita, Mitsuo', 'Theme Song Arrangement, Music']]
