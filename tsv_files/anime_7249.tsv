Houkago Midnighters	Movie	1	08/25/2012	-	1260	6.29	503	7252	10559	Mako, Miko, and Mutsuko are three young girls visiting St. Claire Elementary, a school filled with strange legends. They have an abrupt encounter with Kunstrijk, a human body anatomy model, and Goth, a skeleton model. Both haunt the soon-to-be-demolished science room. Seeking revenge for being vandalized by the three girls, Kunstrijk invites them to the school's midnight party in order to scare them. Together, the five go on a quest to collect three mythical medals that can grant a wish and hopefully save the science room.(Source: ANN)	['Sequel: Houkago Midnighters: Short Movies Season 2']	['Mutsuko', 'Miko', 'Mako', 'Goth', 'Kunstlijk, Louis Thomas Jerome', 'Bach, Johann Sebastian', 'Pinia', 'Sonny', 'Hae-kun', 'Shaburi']	['Kotobuki, Minako', 'Uran, Sakiko', 'Tomatsu, Haruka', 'Hiromasa, Taguchi', 'Yamadera, Kouichi', 'Chafurin', 'Kosugi, Juurouta', 'Kuroda, Yuuki', 'Shimozaki, Hiroshi', 'Iizuka, Shouzou']	[['Kasamatsu, Kouji', 'Sound Effects']]
