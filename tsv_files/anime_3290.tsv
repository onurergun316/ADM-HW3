Re: Cutey Honey	OVA	3	07/24/2004	07/24/2004	24727	7.11	9439	3292	3613	A mysterious organization known as Panther Claw make their presence known by terrorizing Tokyo and giving the cops a run for their money. Police are further baffled by the appearance of a lone cosplaying vigilante who thwarts all of Panther Claw's evil schemes before disappearing. That cosplayer is Honey Kisaragi, the result of the late Professor Kisaragi's prize experiment. A master of disguise, Honey can magically alter her physical appearance and outfits. But with a push of the heart-shaped button on her choker, she transforms herself into Cutie Honey, the scantily-clad, sword-wielding warrior of love and justice.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Cutie Honey a Go Go!', 'Alternative version: Cutey Honey', 'Other: Cutie Honey Universe']	['Kisaragi, Honey', 'Aki, Natsuko', 'Hayami, Seiji', 'Sister Jill', 'Scarlet Claw', 'Black Claw', 'Cobalt Claw', 'Butler', 'Kisaragi, Takeshi', 'Gold Claw']	['Horie, Yui', 'Noda, Junko', 'Ishikawa, Hideo', 'Ikura, Kazue', 'Konno, Hiromi', 'Touma, Yumi', 'Kingetsu, Mami', 'Kiyokawa, Motomu', 'Uemura, Noriko']	[['Satou, Hiroki', 'Producer'], ['Takeda, Yasuhiro', 'Assistant Producer'], ['Anno, Hideaki', 'Director, Episode Director, Key Animation'], ['Imaishi, Hiroyuki', 'Director, Episode Director, Key Animation']]
