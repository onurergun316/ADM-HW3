Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.As ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu', 'Prequel: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Arata Naru Tatakai no Overture', 'Side story: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden', 'Alternative version: Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Die Neue These - Kaikou']	['Yang, Wen-li', 'von Lohengramm, Reinhard', 'von Reuenthal, Oskar', 'von Oberstein, Paul', 'Kircheis, Siegfried', 'von Schönkopf, Walter', 'Mittermeyer, Wolfgang', 'Minci, Julian', 'von Mariendorf, Hildegard', 'Attenborough, Dusty']	['Tomiyama, Kei', 'Horikawa, Ryo', 'Wakamoto, Norio', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Hironaka, Masashi', 'Hazama, Michio', 'Mori, Katsuji', 'Sasaki, Nozomu', 'Katsuki, Masako', 'Inoue, Kazuhiko']	[['Ishiguro, Noboru', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Aketagawa, Susumu', 'Sound Director'], ['Motonaga, Keitarou', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Imaizumi, Kenichi', 'Episode Director, Animation Director, Key Animation, In-Between Animation']]
