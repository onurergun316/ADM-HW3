Ousama Ranking	TV	23	10/15/2021	10/15/2021	74818	8.78	13851	32	1961	"The web manga centers around Bojji, a deaf, powerless prince who cannot even wield a children's sword. As the firstborn son, he strives hard and dreams of becoming the world's greatest king. However, people mutter about him behind his back as ""a good-for-nothing prince"" and ""no way he can be king.""Bojji is able to make his first ever friend, ""Kage"" (shadow)â€”a literal shadow on the ground who somehow understands Bojji well. (Kage is a survivor of the Kage assassin clan that was all but wiped out. No longer a killer, Kage now makes ends meet by stealing.) The story follows Bojji's coming-of-age as he meets various people in his life, starting with his fateful encounter with Kage.(Source: MAL News)"	['Adaptation: Ousama Ranking']	['Bojji', 'Kage', 'Hiling', 'Apeas', 'Hokuro', 'BeBin', 'Bosse', 'Magic Mirror', 'Death-Par', 'Death-Har']	['Hinata, Minami', 'Murase, Ayumu', 'Satou, Rina', 'Yasumoto, Hiroki', 'Yamashita, Daiki', 'Ueda, Youji', 'Miyake, Kenta', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Shimoyama, Yoshimitsu']	[['Okada, Maiko', 'Producer'], ['Hatta, Yousuke', 'Director'], ['Fuchigami, Makoto', 'Director'], ['Ebina, Yasunori', 'Sound Director']]
