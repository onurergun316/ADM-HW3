Though he isn't alone for long, as 10-year-old Haruka (whom dislikes Pokemon, but just wants to come along to see the world) travels with him after Pikachu destroys her bicycle. Satoshi also meets up with his old companion, Takeshi, and Haruka's younger brother, Masato. Together, they travel along in Houen, battling Gym Leaders, entering Contests, and other events on the way to the Houen League.(Source: ANN, edited)	['Prequel: Pokemon', 'Side story: Pokemon Movie 06: Nanayo no Negaiboshi Jirachi', 'Sequel: Pokemon Diamond & Pearl', 'Alternative setting: Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire: Mega Special Animation', 'Summary: Pokemon Diamond & Pearl: Clip Show']	['Pikachu', 'Satoshi', 'Takeshi', 'Haruka', 'Masato', 'Kojirou', 'Kasumi', 'Musashi', 'Nyarth', 'Ookido, Shigeru']	['Ootani, Ikue', 'Matsumoto, Rica', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Kawana, Midori', 'Yamada, Fushigi', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Iizuka, Mayumi', 'Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Inuyama, Inuko', 'Kobayashi, Yuko']	[['Yuyama, Kunihiko', 'Director'], ['Hidaka, Masamitsu', 'Director'], ['Asada, Yuuji', 'Director'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director']]
