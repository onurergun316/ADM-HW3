Pokemon Crystal: Raikou Ikazuchi no Densetsu	Special	1	12/30/2001	-	21864	6.86	11853	4361	3852	Kenta, a Pokemon master in the making, meets up with his childhood friend, Marina, at a Pokemon Center, to see how their skills have developed. Their battle is interrupted by a thunderstorm and the arrival of Bashou and Buson, two Roketto-Dan members using the Crystal System (which attracts Electric-type Pokemon). Their ultimate goal is to, under the guidance of Shiranui-hakase, bring Pokemon back to Sakaki. Kenta and Marina stumble upon this plan, and they try to stop it, but things get more difficult when the legendary Pokemon Raikou is captured.(Source: ANN)	['Alternative setting: Pokemon']	['Kenta', 'Raikou', 'Bashou', 'Buson', 'Joy', 'Junsa', 'Narrator', 'Professor Utsugi', 'Marina', 'Minaki']	['Nojima, Kenji', 'Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Morikawa, Toshiyuki', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Shiraishi, Ayako', 'Nishimura, Chinami', 'Ishizuka, Unshou', 'Inoue, Kazuhiko', 'Murai, Kazusa', 'Kawada, Shinji']	[['Yuyama, Kunihiko', 'Director'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Valencia, Amparo', 'Script, ADR Director'], ['Tsuji, Hatsuki', 'Storyboard, Key Animation']]
