What's Michael? 2	OVA	1	07/25/1988	-	511	6.05	185	8430	12920	"Michael the orange tiger cat returns for another series of vignettes.The sketches this time include a three-part send-up of The Fugitive, the famous 1960's TV show. Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by ""a man with overbite."" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He's a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.(Source: Orphan Fansubs)"	"[""Adaptation: What's Michael?"", ""Character: What's Michael?""]"	['Michael', 'Kimble, Dr. Richard', 'Police Lt.
