Nerima Daikon Brothers	TV	12	01/09/2006	01/09/2006	8074	7.32	3107	2316	5783	In the town of Nerima, the boisterous Hideki and his stoic brother Ichiro run a daikon radish farm along with Mako, their bubbly but vain cousin. The three dream of raising the money needed to build their own concert hall, where their band—Nerima Daikon Brothers—would perform and hopefully rise to stardom. But their farm and Ichiro's host club job aren't raising money fast enough for their liking, leading them to resort to get-rich-quick schemes.Their plans usually involve tracking down evil-doers and then stealing their ill-gotten gains. Yet, while they usually do put a stop to the villains, they always end the day no richer than before. However, neither these failures nor interference from the policewoman Yukika Karakuri can come between this trio and their dream! With help from gadgets provided by the rental shop owner Nabeshin, the Nerima Daikon Brothers get themselves into and out of all kinds of ridiculous situations through their boisterous singing and comedy.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Nerima Daikon Brothers']	['Mako', 'Ichiro', 'Hideki', 'Nabeshin', 'Pandaikon', 'Karakuri, Yukika', 'Hakushon, Yuukel', 'Korean Pachinko Parlor Owner', 'Gokutsubushi', 'Miyo']	['Niina, Ayano', 'Morikubo, Shoutarou', 'Matsuzaki, Shigeru', 'Watanabe, Shinichi', 'Inoue, Marina', 'Yuuki, Hiro', 'Inoue, Kazuhiko', 'Sakamoto, Chika', 'Matsuki, Miyu']	[['Watanabe, Shinichi', 'Director'], ['Ebina, Yasunori', 'Sound Director'], ['Saito, Noriaki', 'Episode Director, Key Animation'], ['Matsuura, Johei', 'Episode Director']]
