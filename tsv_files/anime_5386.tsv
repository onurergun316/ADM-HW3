Lapis Re:LiGHTs	TV	12	07/04/2020	07/04/2020	36081	6.64	11426	5389	3003	Tiara, a princess from the kingdom of Waleland, travels to the city of Mamkestell to attend a prestigious academy for those who practice magic like herself. After passing a test to prove her eligibility, Tiara reunites with her childhood friend Rosetta, who is also a student there. She then joins and meets Rosetta's group: the athletic Lavie, the reliable Ashley, and the bookish Lynetteâ€”all of whom Tiara quickly befriends.In this institution, students are placed into one of three ranks based on their test score: group Noir being the highest, followed by Rouge and Lapis. Tiara's group is ranked Lapis, and if that wasn't enough, those who fail while ranked Lapis face expulsion. Realizing their dire situation, Tiana urges everyone to start taking their activities more seriously.On top of this, Tiara has one more purpose for excelling at the academy: to become more like her elder sister, who is a very skilled singer. However, to reach the stage that she desires, she will have to overcome many challenges, along with her companions, as she continues her magical journey.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Lapis Re:LiGHTs']	['Tiara', 'Rosetta', 'Lavie', 'Lynette', 'Ashley', 'Emilia', 'Garnet', 'Yue', 'Eliza', 'Alpha ']	['Anzai, Yukari', 'Kubota, Risa', 'Mukai, Live', 'Yamamoto, Mizuki', 'Saeki, Iori', 'Hoshino, Hazuki', 'Nakayama, Youko', 'Sakuragi, Yuu', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Mineuchi, Tomomi']	[['Hata, Hiroyuki', 'Director'], ['Naya, Ryousuke', 'Sound Director'], ['Cai, Xinya', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Asano, Hajime', 'Series Composition']]
