Kamisama Hajimemashita	TV	13	10/02/2012	10/02/2012	525096	8.06	265309	478	307	High schooler Nanami Momozono has quite a few problems of late, beginning with her absentee father being in such extreme debt that they lose everything. Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by a dog. After helping him, she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami rescuedâ€”the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.Rather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running smoothly, she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and ends up sealing a contract with him. Now the two must traverse the path of godhood together as god and familiar; but it will not be easy, for new threats arise in the form of a youkai who wants to devour the girl, a snake that wants to marry her, and Nanami's own unexpected feelings for her new familiar.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kamisama Hajimemashita', 'Sequel: Kamisama Hajimemashita OVA']	['Tomoe', 'Momozono, Nanami', 'Mizuki', 'Kurama, Shinjirou', 'Akuraou', 'Mouri, Kirihito', 'Mikage', 'Numa no Himemiko', 'Kotetsu', 'Sukuna']	['Tachibana, Shinnosuke', 'Mimori, Suzuko', 'Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Kishio, Daisuke', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Horie, Yui', 'Ookubo, Chika', 'Namikawa, Daisuke']	[['Daichi, Akitarou', 'Director'], ['Tanaka, Kazuya', 'Sound Director'], ['Koyama, Yoshitaka', 'Episode Director'], ['Yamamoto, Yasuichiro', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
