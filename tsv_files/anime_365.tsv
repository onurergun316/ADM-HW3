Dragon Ball Z	TV	291	04/26/1989	04/26/1989	1032074	8.15	696205	365	96	Five years after winning the World Martial Arts tournament, Gokuu is now living a peaceful life with his wife and son. This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named Raditz who presents himself as Gokuu's long-lost brother. He reveals that Gokuu is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct Saiyan race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to Earth as a baby, Gokuu's sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.With his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting Gokuu as an ally, Raditz warns Gokuu's friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching Earthâ€”one that could plunge Earth into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in Dragon Ball Z.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Dragon Ball', 'Prequel: Dragon Ball', 'Sequel: Dragon Ball GT', 'Side story: Dragon Ball Z Movie 01: Ora no Gohan wo Kaese!!', 'Alternative version: Dragon Ball Kai', 'Character: Kyutai Panic Adventure!', 'Other: Super Dragon Ball Heroes']	['Son, Gokuu', 'Vegeta', 'Son, Gohan', 'Piccolo', 'Kuririn', 'Future Trunks', 'Trunks', 'Freeza', 'Bulma', 'Muten-Roushi']	['Nozawa, Masako', 'Horikawa, Ryo', 'Nozawa, Masako', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Tanaka, Mayumi', 'Kusao, Takeshi', 'Kusao, Takeshi', 'Nakao, Ryusei', 'Tsuru, Hiromi', 'Masuoka, Hiroshi']	[['Seki, Hiromi', 'Assistant Producer'], ['Yamauchi, Shigeyasu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Yamamuro, Tadayoshi', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Nishio, Daisuke', 'Director, Episode Director']]
