To protect Arma, the resistance group ARMS assigns the dual Mecha-ude user Aki Murasame to follow him wherever he goes. However, she is also looking for a mysterious Snake-Type Mecha-ude wielder, who has put many of her comrades in a critical state.Behind the scenes, an organization known as the Kagami Group is searching for the mythical ""Trigger Arm,"" a Mecha-ude said to grant unlimited power.
