One week after losing his wife in an accident, the father of the household, Kenichi, starts to view his four daughters in a way that goes beyond a regular parent-child relationship. He soon becomes unable to resist their beautiful figures, and giving in to his carnal incestuous desires, he starts to have his way with them one by one.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Oni Chichi', 'Alternative version: Oni Chichi', 'Sequel: Oni Chichi 2: Revenge']	['Makino, Natsume', 'Makino, Akira', 'Makino, Haruka', 'Makino, Fuyu', 'Makino, Kenichi']	['Kawaragi, Shiho']	[['Shiraishi, Michita', 'Episode Director'], ['Pon', 'Script'], ['Blue Gale', 'Original Creator'], ['Kinohara, Hikaru', 'Character Design']]
