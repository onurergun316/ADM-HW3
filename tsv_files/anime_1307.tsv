The Adventurers are starting to gain the trust of the People of the Land, and Akiba has flourished thanks to the law and order established by Shiroe's Round Table Alliance, regaining its everyday liveliness. Despite this success, however, the Alliance faces a new crisis: they are running out of funds to govern Akiba, and spies from the Minami district have infiltrated the city.As formidable forces rise in other districts, there is also a need to discover more about the vast new world they are trapped inâ€”leading Shiroe to decide that the time has come to venture outside the city.
