Cencoroll	Movie	1	07/28/2009	-	90547	7.18	40700	2950	1740	When a gigantic, unearthly monster suddenly looms on the skyline of a Japanese city, the expected occurs—the Japan Self-Defense Forces roll out the tanks while the public panics. Nobody knows what it is or where it came from, but Yuki, a bold and inquisitive teenage girl, has a secret but might be a useful clue. Her friend Tetsu has been clandestinely caring for a bizarre creature called Cenco, which will soon prove itself to have some remarkable, even impossible characteristics. Another teenage boy, a stranger with some mysterious link to the monstrosity attacking the city, shows up, and his unwelcome interest in Tetsu's pet snuffs out any doubt of a connection—and lights the fuse for the coming battle.(Source: Rupert Bottenberg, Fantasia Genre Film Festival)	['Adaptation: Amon Game', 'Sequel: Cencoroll Connect']	['Amamiya, Tetsu', 'Cenco', 'Yuki', 'Shuu', 'Kei']	['Shimono, Hiro', 'Hanazawa, Kana', 'Kimura, Ryouhei', 'Moriya, Satomi']	[['Uki, Atsuya', 'Director, Script, Key Animation, Creator'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['supercell', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Yanagi, Nagi', 'Theme Song Performance']]
