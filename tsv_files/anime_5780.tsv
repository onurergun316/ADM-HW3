Left to fend for himself, Koushi collapses on the street, but an eccentric woman named Mineru Wachi takes pity on him and brings him to the female dormitory ""Megami-ryou.""After learning of Koushi's situation, Mineru, who happens to be the temporary manager, invites him to become Megami-ryou's official dormitory mother.
