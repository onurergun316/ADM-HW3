The academy is renowned as the most elite school in existence, with its graduates guaranteed virtually any job they desire. However, one can only become a student if they pass the entrance examinations held every three years, making the competition for admission extremely fierce.Lane Tadatos is a Terran who has managed to reach the final stage of examinations. Placed in a group of 10, he is sent to the Esperanzaâ€”a ship stranded in orbit. Their final test is to survive 53 days on the ship, without any means of communication with the outside other than an emergency forfeit button. But a serious problem emerges for the examinees when they perform a headcount. There are 11 people aboard the Esperanza, meaning that one of them is an impostor.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: 11-nin Iru!']	['Frolbericheri, Frol', 'Tadatos, Lane', 'Baceska, King Mayan', 'Ni, Toto', 'Kacka, Chako', 'Narrator', 'Soldam IV, Doricas', 'Groff, Glenn', 'Carnais, Amazon', 'Tasta, Dolph']	['Kawai, Michiko', 'Kamiya, Akira', 'Tanaka, Hideyuki', 'Tarako', 'Kashiwakura, Tsutomu', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Ikemizu, Michihiro', 'Suzuoki, Hirotaka', 'Shioya, Kouzou']	[['Tominaga, Tsuneo', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Dezaki, Satoshi', 'Director'], ['Nakamura, Ryuutarou', 'Storyboard'], ['Hagio, Moto', 'Original Creator']]
