Chicchana Yukitsukai Sugar Specials	Special	2	08/21/2003	08/21/2003	5063	7.03	2158	3675	6954	"When Saga—now 15 years old—arrives at her home after a day of errands, her grandmother Regina discovers an old dress in the attic. At this point, Saga recalls the time her elementary class participated in a play titled ""Princess and Fairy."" She volunteered to play the role of the Princess while her rival Greta played the evil witch. The production of the school play reminded Sugar and the other fairies of the time ""The Bear Pianist"" played in the town not too long ago."
