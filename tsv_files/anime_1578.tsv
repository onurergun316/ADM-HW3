Zombieland Saga	TV	12	10/04/2018	10/04/2018	402822	7.52	184436	1578	412	Sakura Minamoto dreams of becoming an idol. Unfortunately, reality hits her like a truck, and she dies in a sudden traffic accident. Ten years later, she wakes up in Saga Prefecture, only to find herself a zombie with no memory of her past. While still coming to terms with her demise, she meets a man named Koutarou Tatsumi, who explains that he has resurrected her and six other zombie girls from different eras for the purpose of economically revitalizing Saga by means of an idol group. Assuming the role of an abrasive manager, Koutarou begins scheduling events; the girls go along with it, eventually deciding to name their idol group Franchouchou.An absurdly comedic take on the idol genre, Zombieland Saga tells the story of Franchouchou's heartwarming struggle to save Saga Prefecture while hiding their zombie identities and rediscovering their past lives.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Zombieland Saga', 'Sequel: Zombieland Saga: Revenge', 'Other: Curry Meshi x Zombieland Saga']	['Tatsumi, Koutarou', 'Nikaidou, Saki', 'Mizuno, Ai', 'Yamada, Tae', 'Minamoto, Sakura', 'Konno, Junko', 'Hoshikawa, Lily', 'Yuugiri', 'Romero', 'Policeman A']	['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Tano, Asami', 'Taneda, Risa', 'Mitsuishi, Kotono', 'Hondo, Kaede', 'Kawase, Maki', 'Tanaka, Minami', 'Kinugawa, Rika', 'Takato, Yasuhiro', 'Yoshino, Hiroyuki']	[['Sakai, Munehisa', 'Director, Sound Director'], ['Park, Seong-Hu', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation, Animation Director'], ['Itou, Tatsufumi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Shimizu, Hisatoshi', 'Episode Director']]
