Just traveling to the Solomon Islands is a long way for a high school girl to go on her own, but then Yukari runs into an astronaut from the Solomon Space Association, which has been trying to build a rocket powerful enough launch a man into space.Upon meeting the petite Yukari, however, SSA director Nasuda realizes that she's small enough to go up in a less powerful rocket the SSA has already built! So he offers her a deal: if Yukari agrees to become their astronaut, the SSA will help find her missing father! Will Yukari have the right stuff to blast off in the wildest space quest ever?(Source: Sentai Filmworks)	['Adaptation: Rocket Girls']	['Morita, Yukari', 'Miura, Akane', 'Matsuri', 'Asahikawa, Satsuki', 'Grant, George', 'Onoda', 'Randolph, Norman', 'Miura, Hideto', 'Miyamoto', 'Mukai, Hiroyuki']	['Sendai, Eri', 'Hasegawa, Shizuka', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Yanagisawa, Mayumi', 'Miyashita, Eiji', 'Cho', 'Kase, Yasuyuki', 'Asano, Mayumi', 'Taniguchi, Takashi', 'Domon, Jin']	[['Aoyama, Hiroshi', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Sogo, Masashi', 'Script'], ['Nakase, Rika', 'Script, Series Composition']]
