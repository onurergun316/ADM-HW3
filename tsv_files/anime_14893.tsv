In the shorts' story, the Seven Gods of Fortune slack in their duties in heaven, and Susanoo-no-Mikoto banishes them to Awaji Island. In order to return to the heavenly realm, they must help bring happiness to humans and rebuild their virtue. The outcast gods reluctantly grant human wishes and accumulate points in their ""god phones"" to be able to return to heaven.

When they fail, they lose points, further prolonging their stay on Awaji Island.(Source: ANN)"	...	[]	[]	NA
