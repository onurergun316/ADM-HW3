Jarinko Chie	Movie	1	04/11/1981	-	3469	7.03	1402	3692	8021	"Jarinko Chie is a movie directed by Takahata in 1981. Based on the very popular manga by Etsumi HARUKI, it is about ten year old Chie, ""the most unfortunate girl in Japan"", who manages her family diner while her unemployed yakuza father and her mother are separated. This sounds really depressing, but it's actually a very funny comedy. The story is set in Osaka, which has a totally different culture from Tokyo. After the success of the movie, a TV series was made, and Takahata worked as the chief director.(Source: nausicaa.net)"	['Adaptation: Jarinko Chie', 'Alternative version: Jarinko Chie (TV)', 'Character: Chie-chan Funsenki: Jarinko Chie']	['Takemoto, Chie', 'Takemoto, Tetsu', 'Yurine, Kouzou', 'Maruyama, Mitsuru', 'Takemoto, Yoshie']	['Nakayama, Chinatsu', 'Nishikawa, Norio', 'Ashiya, Gannosuke', 'Mitsubayashi, Kyouko']	[['Takahata, Isao', 'Director, Script'], ['Kisugi, Takao', 'Theme Song Composition'], ['Ootsuka, Yasuo', 'Character Design'], ['Nanba, Hitoshi', 'In-Between Animation']]
