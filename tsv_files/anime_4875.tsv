Hoshi no Oujisama Petit Prince	TV	35	07/04/1978	07/04/1978	1620	6.75	423	4877	9995	The Little Prince lives on Asteroid B612, a tiny rock floating in space. He spends his days cleaning out the three small volcanoes on the asteroid (which he also uses to cook his breakfast) weeding out the baobob trees that threaten to take over, and caring for his friend the Rose Girl. When he gets lonely for company he catches a comet in his butterfly net and flies off to Earth for all sorts of adventures.(Source: ANN)	['Sequel: Hoshi no Oujisama Petitâ˜†Prince Specials']	['The Boss']	['Takahashi, Kazue']	[['Kanda, Takeyuki', 'Director'], ['Yasuhiko, Yoshikazu', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Animation Director, Character Design'], ['Mori, Yasuji', 'Animation Director'], ['Tanaka, Eiji', 'Character Design']]
