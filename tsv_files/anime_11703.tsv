Naruto appears to be an overbearing sis-con. In fact, he's madly in love with Anzu, because they're not blood-related. He confines her to the family mansion for ""security,"" depriving her of companionship and a real life. At age 16, she starts to rebel. She smuggles in a kitten as a pet (Naruto hates cats) and then escapes in a delivery truck. Naruto catches up to her and realizes that she can't be confined like a bird in a cage. He agrees to let have a normal life, but just then, tragedy strikes (Source: Collectr)"	['Adaptation: Juliet']	['Nozaki, Anne', 'Nozaki, Naruto', 'Mio']	['Araki, Kae', 'Yamanoi, Jin', 'Itou, Kentarou']	[['Tominaga, Tsuneo', 'Director'], ['U-jin', 'Original Creator'], ['Kobayashi, Toshimitsu', 'Character Design']]
