Chouetsu Sekai	OVA	10	01/01/1991	-	527	5.83	163	9273	12827	Aum Shinrikyou is a Japanese doomsday cult founded by Shoko Asahara in 1984. It carried out the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for another smaller sarin attack the previous year. The cult created its own studio called MAT (Manga, Animation, and Team) in 1991 for the sole purpose of recruiting otaku into their cult. This 10 episode OVA mostly focuses around Asahara himself being Christ. All 10 episodes were sold separately during its initial release but a compilation is available on the cult's official YouTube channel.
