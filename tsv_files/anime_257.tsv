Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu	TV	25	04/04/2016	04/04/2016	1787154	8.26	1120402	257	21	When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu', 'Spin-off: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time', 'Side story: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Memory Snow', 'Other: He Wei Dao x Re:Cong Ling Kaishi de Yi Shijie Shenghuo', 'Prequel: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Hyouketsu no Kizuna', 'Character: Isekai Quartet', 'Sequel: Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season']	['Emilia', 'Natsuki, Subaru', 'Rem', 'Beatrice', 'Ram', 'Argyle, Felix', 'Romanée-Conti, Petelgeuse', 'Suwen, Otto', 'Pack', 'Karsten, Crusch']	['Takahashi, Rie', 'Kobayashi, Yuusuke', 'Minase, Inori', 'Arai, Satomi', 'Murakawa, Rie', 'Horie, Yui', 'Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Amasaki, Kouhei', 'Uchiyama, Yumi', 'Iguchi, Yuka']	[['Watanabe, Masaharu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Takashima, Daisuke', 'Episode Director'], ['Okamoto, Manabu', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation']]
