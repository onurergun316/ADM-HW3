Their family employs countless magicians and other supernatural beings in order to send them out to help those who need magical assistance. As a leader, Itsuki now has to be tough, commanding, and reliable, but there's one problem, he's a coward. Also, in order to run a successful business, he must connect with his employees, which is more difficult than it seems due to his personality. But not only does he have to deal with his own employees, he also has to deal with those who threaten the family business.(Source: CrunchyRoll)	['Adaptation: Rental Magica']	['Ren Mathers, Adelicia', 'Iba, Itsuki', 'Nekoyashiki, Ren', 'Kuroha, Manami', 'Takase Ambler, Honami', 'Katsuragi, Mikan', 'Cruda, Fin', 'Gara', 'Hyoudo', 'Daphne']	['Takahashi, Mikako', 'Fukuyama, Jun', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Ueda, Kana', 'Kugimiya, Rie', 'Miyano, Mamoru', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Itou, Kentarou', 'Kaida, Yuuko']	[['Kawasaki, Itsurou', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Shiraishi, Michita', 'Episode Director'], ['Yamada, Yuka', 'Script']]
