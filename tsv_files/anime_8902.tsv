Rainbow Signal: Hi-Fi Set	...	1	02/01/1985	-	339	5.94	156	8905	14141	These are six loosely-related anime/live-action music videos from the band Hi-Fi Set. For the most part, they form a story about the love life of two cute dragons who live in a high-tech future city. This disc was released in 1985, right in the middle of Hi-Fi Set's career (1974-1994), and features songs from that era (from their 1984 and 1985 albums Pasadena Park and Indigo).(Source: Piyo-Piyo Productions)	...
