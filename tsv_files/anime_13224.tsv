Shika no Ou: Yuna to Yakusoku no Tabi	Movie	1	06/14/2021	-	17232		0	13230	4270	In the years following a vicious war, the Empire of Zol now controls the land and citizens of rival Aquafaâ€”except for Aquafa's Fire Horse Territory, where wild dogs that once carried the deadly Black Wolf Fever continue to roam free. When a pack of dogs race through a Zol-controlled mine, Van, an enslaved former soldier, and a young girl named Yuna are both bitten, but manage to escape as the sole survivors of the attack. Finally free, Van and Yuna seek out a simple, peaceful existence in the countryside. But as the deadly disease once again runs rampant, they find themselves at the crossroads of a struggle much larger than any one nation.(Source: GKIDS)	['Adaptation: Shika no Ou: Yuna to Yakusoku no Tabi']	['Makoukan', 'Sae', 'Hossal', 'Yuna', 'Van', 'Pyuika', 'Sforsam, Tohrim', 'Yotal', 'Akafah King', 'Rimuell']	['Watanabe, Anne', 'Takeuchi, Ryouma', 'Kimura, Hisui', 'Tsutsumi, Shinichi']	[['Matsushita, Keiko', 'Producer'], ['Andou, Masashi', 'Director, Chief Animation Director, Character Design, Animation Director'], ['Miyaji, Masayuki', 'Director'], ['Kikuta, Hiromi', 'Sound Director']]
