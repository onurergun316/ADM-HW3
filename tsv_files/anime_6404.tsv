Clockwork Planet	TV	12	04/07/2017	04/07/2017	140712	6.45	51657	6408	1245	Legend tells that when the Earth was destroyed, the great clockmaker Y made a replacement from cogs and gears. Naoto Miura is a young boy who aspires to be a great clockmaker. However, despite his unique talent—sensitive hearing that can immediately understand clockwork mechanics from noise alone—he has made little progress. But this changes when a coffin falls from the sky into his apartment, revealing RyuZU, a female automaton forged by Y himself.News of RyuZU's arrival brings Marie Bell Breguet, the gifted heir of a distinguished line of clockmakers, and her cyborg bodyguard Vainney Halter into Naoto's life as well. When she and Naoto both become embroiled in an action-packed battle for their lives, they discover an uncomfortable truth: the clockwork planet that humanity has lived on for over a millennium is beginning to break down—a secret that many people will kill to protect.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Clockwork Planet']	['RyuZU', 'Miura, Naoto', 'AnchoR', 'Halter, Vainney', 'Bell Breguet, Marie', 'Konrad', 'Hoshimiya, Houko', 'Vermouth', 'Strega', 'Amaretto']	['Kakuma, Ai', 'Nanjou, Yoshino', 'Senbongi, Sayaka', 'Matsuda, Kenichirou', 'Oonishi, Saori', 'Ishizuka, Unshou', 'Uchida, Maaya', 'Matsuda, Satsumi', 'Yoshimura, Haruka', 'Mogi, Takamasa']	[['Nagasawa, Tsuyoshi', 'Director'], ['Motoyama, Satoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Oonishi, Kenta', 'Episode Director'], ['Saitou, Akira', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Editing']]
