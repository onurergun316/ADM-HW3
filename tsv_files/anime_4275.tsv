Funded entirely out of its own deep pockets, it was hoped that the school would be a haven for young men and women on whose shoulders our future would rest.The School is open to any talented individual, irrespective of his or her lineage or financial standing and is known to count scores of singularly talented pupils. It is furthermore also famous for its harboring of a remarkable percentage of party animals. Not even the bright and talented minds of CLAMP School can keep the campus free of crimes and mysteries. Or can they? Join Nokoru, Suoh and Akira, our case-cracking kid detectives, as they save the day and even the odd damsel in distress!(Source: Bandai Entertainment)	['Adaptation: Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan', 'Side story: Aruhi no Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan']	"['Imonoyama, Nokoru', 'Takamura, Suou', 'Ijyuuin, Akira', 'Miyuki', 'Azuya, Nagisa', 'Ohkawa, Utako', ""Suoh's Mother"", 'Kudo, Yukiko', 'Kyogoku, Midoriko', 'Shukaido, Takeshi']"	['Okamura, Akemi', 'Niiyama, Shiho', 'Minami, Omi', 'Kouda, Mariko', 'Ikezawa, Haruna', 'Miyamura, Yuko', 'Takashima, Gara', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Hidaka, Noriko', 'Kusao, Takeshi']	[['Maseba, Yutaka', 'Producer'], ['Nabeshima, Osamu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Fujiyama, Fusanobu', 'Sound Director'], ['Kosaka, Harume', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
