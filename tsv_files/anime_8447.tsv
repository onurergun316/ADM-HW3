Hangyakusei Million Arthur	TV	10	10/25/2018	10/25/2018	30346	6.05	5461	8450	3290	Tales of old speak of the legends of Excalibur, a sacred sword. The sword is wielded by those who are worthy of its power, bestowing them extraordinary strength and granting them the title of Arthur. However, a divine miracle results in the creation of multiple Excaliburs, thus distorting the fabric of time.Aiming to revert time to its original course, a group of six Arthurs composed of Danchou, Renkin, Kakka, Yamaneko, Tekken, and Rurou are sent back in time when the abnormal Excaliburs were spawned. They are assigned with one sole task: to destroy the Excaliburs of the pastâ€”all of which total up to one million.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Other: Jakusansei Million Arthur', 'Sequel: Hangyakusei Million Arthur 2nd Season', 'Alternative version: Hangyakusei Million Arthur PV']	['Danchou Arthur', 'Kakka Arthur', 'Renkin Arthur', 'Tekken Arthur', 'Yamaneko Arthur', 'Bodach', 'Rurou Arthur', 'Titania', 'Coupy', 'Bethor']	['Amamiya, Sora', 'Hanae, Natsuki', 'Minase, Inori', 'Kakihara, Tetsuya', 'Taketatsu, Ayana', 'Mimori, Suzuko', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'Takahashi, Rie', 'Touyama, Nao', 'Hidaka, Rina']	[['Suzuki, Youhei', 'Director'], ['Iwanami, Yoshikazu', 'Sound Director'], ['Tamai, Tsuyoshi', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Minakami, Seishi', 'Script']]
