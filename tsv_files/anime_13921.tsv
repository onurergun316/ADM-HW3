Totsugeki! Pappara-tai	TV	25	10/03/1998	10/03/1998	732		0	13927	11947	An elite soldier, whose nickname is God of Death, is transferred to another unit known as the PaPaRa Army. The PaPaRa Army is infamous for its elite but hilariously crazy members. There is no plot to speak of other than humour, hilarious brutality, and general nonsense. This is also Matsuzawa-sensei's debut work.	['Adaptation: Totsugeki!
