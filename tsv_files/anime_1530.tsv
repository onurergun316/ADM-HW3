Fantastic Children	TV	26	10/05/2004	10/05/2004	29333	7.53	6720	1531	3324	A group of enigmatic white-haired children has been spotted at different times and places in Europe for over 500 years. Always with the appearance of 11-year-olds, they behave far more mature than they should be, never grow old, and seem to have supernatural power. What they have been seeking is a girl, and the only clue they have is a picture with a crescent moon. Now, in the year of 2012, an athletic boy named Tohma is about to be involved in this centuries-long mystery.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Fantastic Children: Tokei Jikake no Tabibito-tachi', 'Sequel: Fantastic Children: Befort no Kodomo-tachi no Sonogo']	['Thoma', 'Agi', 'Soreto', 'Seth', 'Hasmodai', 'Mel', 'Dumas', 'Lui, Helga', 'Kulana, Chitto', 'Tarlant']	['Minagawa, Junko', 'Urata, Yuu', 'Takaguchi, Yukiko', 'Gotou, Satoshi', 'Matsumoto, Sachi', 'Sakamoto, Maaya', 'Hanawa, Eiji', 'Kawaragi, Shiho', 'Kobayashi, Kei', 'Yaguchi, Asami']	[['Nakamura, Takashi', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard, Character Design, Original Creator'], ['Hayase, Hiroyuki', 'Sound Director'], ['Kaburagi, Hiro', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Shimizu, Kenichi', 'Episode Director']]
