There were a mistress, who was surrounded by books and pictures and loved camera, and the four maids who smiled sadly. They seemed to know everything. However, I couldn’t remember anything.“You brought the time into this house where time had stopped”.The gear began to work as if it was led by the folklore of spiriting away talked in the candle light.
