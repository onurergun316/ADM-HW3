Death Parade	TV	12	01/10/2015	01/10/2015	1443661	8.18	807275	338	48	After death, there is no heaven or hell, only a bar that stands between reincarnation and oblivion. There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the recently deceased to a random game in which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or falling into the void will be wagered. Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person's true nature will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar's master. Welcome to Quindecim, where Decim, arbiter of the afterlife, awaits!Death Parade expands upon the original one-shot intended to train young animators. It follows yet more people receiving judgmentâ€”until a strange, black-haired guest causes Decim to begin questioning his own rulings.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Alternative version: Death Billiards']	['Decim', 'Kurokami no Onna', 'Nona', 'Clavis', 'Ginti', 'Arita, Mayu', 'Quin', 'Tatsumi', 'Castra', 'Oculus']	['Maeno, Tomoaki', 'Seto, Asami', 'Ookubo, Rumi', 'Uchiyama, Kouki', 'Hosoya, Yoshimasa', 'Tanezaki, Atsumi', 'Shiraishi, Ryouko', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Yuzuki, Ryouka', 'Genda, Tesshou']	[['Tachikawa, Yuzuru', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Original Creator, Series Composition'], ['Motoyama, Satoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Watanabe, Shinichiro', 'Episode Director'], ['Ushijima, Shinichirou', 'Episode Director']]
