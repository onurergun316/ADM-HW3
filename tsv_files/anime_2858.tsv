After rescuing him, she continues on, but from this moment on, her life takes a drastic turn.Grateful for rescuing the pup, the shrine goddess Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, ""Uka-sama,"" grants Inari a fragment of her power. Now, Inari has the ability to transform into anyone by shouting the magical phrase ""Inari, konkon."" Could this power also grant her the courage to convey her feelings to her crush, Kouji Tanbabashi? With her new heavenly ability and the fox spirit Kon, Inari forms a sincere friendship with Uka-sama, encounters more of the supernatural world, and learns that true love knows no bounds.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.', 'Sequel: Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.: Inari, Konkon, Semishigure.']	['Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami', 'Fushimi, Inari', 'Fushimi, Touka', 'Kon', 'Sumizome, Akemi', 'Tanbabashi, Kouji', 'Sanjou, Keiko', 'Oomiyanome-no-kami', 'Ootoshi-no-kami', 'Marutamachi, Chika']	['Kuwashima, Houko', 'Oozora, Naomi', 'Ueda, Youji', 'Hara, Sayuri', 'Nomizu, Iori', 'Okamoto, Hiroshi', 'Ikebe, Kumiko', 'Mikami, Shiori', 'Koyasu, Takehito', 'Sadohara, Kaori']	[['Takahashi, Tooru', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Katou, Makoto', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Okamoto, Hideki', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Assistant Director'], ['Machida, Touko', 'Script']]
