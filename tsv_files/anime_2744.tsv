She is often called ""Chibi Maruko-chan"" due to her young age and small size. She lives together with her parents, her grandparents and her elder sister in a little town. In school, she has many friends with whom she studies and plays together everyday, including her close pal, Tama-chan; the student committee members, Maruo-kun and Migiwa-san; and the B-class trio: 'little master' Hanawa-kun, Hamaji-Bu Taro and Sekiguchi-kun. This is a fun-loving and enjoyable anime that portrays the simple things in life.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Chibi Maruko-chan', 'Prequel: Chibi Maruko-chan', 'Other: Planetarium Chibi Maruko-chan, Hoshi ni Negai wo', 'Side story: Chibi Maruko-chan Movie: Italia kara Kita Shounen']	['Sakura, Momoko', 'Yamada, Shouta', 'Sakura, Tomozou', 'Sakura, Sakiko', 'Yamane, Tsuyoshi', 'Fujiki, Shigeru', 'Oono, Kenichi', 'Hanawa, Kazuhiko', 'Sugiyama, Satoshi', 'Nagasawa, Kimio']	['Tarako', 'Yamamoto, Keiko', 'Tomiyama, Kei', 'Mizutani, Yuuko', 'Suyama, Akio', 'Naka, Tomoko', 'Numata, Yusuke', 'Kikuchi, Masami', 'Mayama, Ako', 'Chafurin']	[['Suda, Yumiko', 'Director'], ['Takagi, Jun', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Katabuchi, Sunao', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Katou, Makoto', 'Episode Director']]
