While there, the three Saiyans reflect back on the events that occurred during the Cell Games. Inside the house after Chi-Chi appeared, Goku tells his sons about Pikkon and the Other World Tournament.Later, the four members of the Son family appear dressed nicely. Gohan says that the adult division of the Tournament will begin this next year (in 1994), and the special comes to an end.(Source: Dragon Ball Wikia)	['Full story: Dragon Ball Z']	['Son, Gokuu', 'Son, Gohan', 'Son, Goten', 'Cell']	[]	NA
