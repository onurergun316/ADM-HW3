Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki	TV	12	10/05/2016	10/05/2016	27017	6.45	8743	6422	3471	This is the visual diary of Kiitarou's experience with youkai. He's a boy with a very strong spirit sense, but when he entered a forbidden storehouse, he was kicked out of his home. He soon found a new place to live, where he met a zashiki warashi (house spirit) named Suzu. He and Suzu soon began to attract all kinds of spirit creatures, starting with a nurikabe (appears as a wall that impedes travelers) and mokumokuren (appears as eyes in a torn paper wall). What kind of folkloric creature will he meet next?(Source: MangaHelpers)	['Adaptation: Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki', 'Sequel: Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki: Jonan no Saijitsu']	['Kiitarou', 'Kitsunemen no Onna', 'Suzu', 'Yukimusume', 'Yukihaha']	['Igarashi, Hiromi', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Nakada, Arisa', 'Naganawa, Maria', 'Ohara, Sayaka']	[['Hirasawa, Hisayoshi', 'Director'], ['Mouri, Nora', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['WORDS in STEREO', 'Script, Series Composition'], ['Hayasaka, Satsuki', 'Key Animation']]
