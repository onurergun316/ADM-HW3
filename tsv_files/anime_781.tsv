K-On!!: Keikaku!	Special	1	03/16/2011	-	107887	7.84	60760	781	1526	The summer holidays are coming to an end, but the girls from Houkago Tea Time want to take one more trip before their next semester starts. With countless travel destinations to choose from and as many preferences as there are club members, coming to an agreement seems far-flung.Unable to reach a decision, they remember that they must first apply for new passports.
