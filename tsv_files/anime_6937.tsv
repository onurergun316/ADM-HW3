Gundam Neo Experience 0087: Green Divers	Movie	1	08/10/2001	-	3124	6.35	577	6940	8278	During the closing days of the Gryps conflict of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, two siblings—Asagi and Takuya—ride aboard a civilian transport bound for Earth. Caught in a battle between the Titans and AEUG, they must somehow guide their ship through atmospheric entry. Luckily, they're not completely alone, as they find aid from a custom-painted Zeta Gundam, whose pilot sounds a lot like One Year War ace Amuro Ray.(Source: ANN)	['Parent story: Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam']	['Bayard, Jack']	['Fukuyama, Jun']	[['Yatate, Hajime', 'Original Creator'], ['Ookawara, Kunio', 'Mechanical Design']]
