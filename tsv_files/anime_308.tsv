Up until now, he has been relying on a simple plan, which is to calculatingly bump into her every day while making it seem like a meaningful coincidence. However, his efforts remain futile as their relationship is not progressing at all.Meanwhile, the black-haired girl believes that everything is connected by fate and endeavors to experience as many new things as possible, leaving it all for destiny to decide. While strolling along the lively streets of Kyoto, she discovers that the very beginning of her fateful journey—a book she had as a child—is currently being sold in a second-hand bookstore. Upon knowing this, the college student eyes another opportunity to run into her ""by chance"": this time, he hopes to get the book before she does and finally grasp the thread of fate that could connect their hearts.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Yoru wa Mijikashi Aruke yo Otome', 'Character: Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei']	['Kurokami no Otome', 'Senpai', 'Higuchi, Seitarou', 'Johnny', 'Hanuki, Ryouko', 'Jimukyokuchou, Gakuensai', 'Pantsu Soubanchou', 'Princess Daruma', 'Toudou-san', 'Li, Bai']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Hoshino, Gen', 'Nakai, Kazuya', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Kaida, Yuuko', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Akiyama, Ryuuji', 'Yuuki, Aoi', 'Yamaji, Kazuhiro', 'Mugihito']	[['Choi, Eun-Young', 'Producer, Storyboard'], ['Yuasa, Masaaki', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Kimura, Eriko', 'Sound Director'], ['Heo, Pyeonggang', 'Episode Director']]
