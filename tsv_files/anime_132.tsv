With an overwhelming dark energy emanating from the arm, the two are forced to work together in order to keep it contained. However, the demonic arm is not the only dark force lurking in the region, and as spiritual tensions rise in the mountains of the Gusu Lan Clan, it is up to the two of them to try and restore the natural order.The story of Wei Wuxian's fall from grace continues as more light is shed on his descent into the path of demonic cultivation. The demonic arm only further strains his mischievous spirit. This is the time for him to prove that he has truly broken free from the forbidden path and is not the maniacal sorcerer that everyone remembers him to be.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Prequel: Mo Dao Zu Shi', 'Sequel: Mo Dao Zu Shi: Wanjie Pian', 'Other: Mo Dao Zu Shi Q']	['Wei, Wuxian', 'Lan, Wangji', 'Jiang, Wanyin', 'Wen, Ning', 'Nie, Huaisang', 'Lan, Sizhui', 'Jiang, Yanli', 'Lan, Xichen', 'Jin, Ling', 'Jin, Guangyao']	['Zhang, Jie', 'Bian, Jiang', 'Guo, Haoran', 'Shao, Tong', 'Liu, Sanmu', 'Chenzhang, Taikang', 'Li, Shimeng', 'Jin, Xian', 'Su, Shangqing']	[['Xiong, Ke', 'Director, Art Director'], ['Liu, Xing', 'Script'], ['Liang, Sha', 'Script'], ['Zhu, Ke', 'Script']]
