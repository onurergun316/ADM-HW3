Tejina-senpai	TV	12	07/02/2019	07/02/2019	217991	6.44	95186	6479	823	Starting his new term at Tanenashi High School, an unmotivated freshman searches for a club that requires minimal participation to suit his needs. He then comes across the magic clubroom, and inside is a cute upperclassman practicing her magic tricks. Suffering from stage fright that causes her to slip up in her acts, she has a tendency to end up in the most embarrassing situations. Despite having little interest in a club run by an incapable magician, the freshman finds himself involved as a new member, experiencing all sorts of awkward moments with his eccentric mentor.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Tejina-senpai']	"['Senpai', 'Assistant', 'Madara-san', 'Saki-chan', 'Masashi', ""Tejina's Sister"", 'Mimura']"	['Hondo, Kaede', 'Ichikawa, Aoi', 'Takahashi, Rie', 'Kitamura, Eri', 'Namikawa, Daisuke', 'Akaneya, Himika', 'Masuda, Toshiki']	[['Shiba, Hirokazu', 'Producer'], ['Usui, Fumiaki', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Ikeda, Rintarou', 'Script, Series Composition']]
