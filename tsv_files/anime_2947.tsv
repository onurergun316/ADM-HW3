Black Jack: Futari no Kuroi Isha	Movie	1	12/17/2005	-	4337	7.18	1688	2949	7422	The mega-corporate Daedalus Group is under attack by a small group of activists known as the Ghost of Icarus. While taking care of some of the victims of the bombing, Black Jack encounters Dr. Kiriko, also known as Death Incarnate, who just like him, asks his patients huge sums of money but instead of saving them, he offers them a painless death. When the activist group requests both doctorsâ€™ collaboration, Black Jack finds himself caught in a spiral of life, death and treason while trying to save his patients' lives and avoid the breaking of a biological war that could destroy humanity.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Black Jack', 'Parent story: Black Jack (TV)', 'Side story: Black Jack: Dr. Pinoko no Mori no Bouken', 'Other: Black Jack: Futari no Kuroi Isha - Manner Movie']	['Hazama, Kuroo', 'Holmes, Rock', 'Doctor Kiriko', 'Biwamaru', 'Pinoko', 'Midori', 'Honma, Kumiko', 'Largo']	['Ootsuka, Akio', 'Kaga, Takeshi', 'Mizutani, Yuuko', 'Hirayama, Aya', 'Kawase, Akiko']	[['Tezuka, Makoto', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Takeuchi, Yoshio', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Kuwahara, Satoshi', 'Storyboard'], ['Tezuka, Osamu', 'Original Creator']]
