Senkou no Night Raid	TV	13	04/06/2010	04/06/2010	41694	6.86	10732	4368	2738	"The year is 1931. The city is Shanghai. Ten years before America will enter World War II, the hydra's teeth planted by the first great global conflict are beginning to germinate. Hatching like spiders, they weave the complex web of plots and conspiracies destined to inevitably draw entire nations to the brink of destruction. Caught in the heart of these webs, desperately seeking to separate lies from truth, is ""Sakurai Kikan,"" an ultra-secret intelligence agency staffed by extraordinarily talented individuals with abilities far beyond those of normal humans. Their duty: to stop the darkest plots and eliminate the greatest threats. But in a city built on intrigue, can even a team of clairvoyants, telepaths and espers stand against the ultimate forces of destiny?(Source: Sentai Filmworks)"	['Side story: Senkou no Night Raid Specials', 'Summary: Senkou no Night Raid: Yogen']	['Miyoshi, Aoi', 'Iha, Kazura', 'Sonogi, Yukina', 'Kagiya, Natsume', 'Ichinose', 'Kuse', 'Takachiho, Isao', 'Fuuran', 'Nishio', 'Ichishi']	['Yoshino, Hiroyuki', 'Namikawa, Daisuke', 'Ikuta, Yoshiko', 'Hoshino, Takanori', 'Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Miyauchi, Atsushi', 'Hirata, Hiroaki', 'Fujita, Saki', 'Katsu, Anri']	[['Ishihama, Masashi', 'Director, Episode Director'], ['Matsumoto, Atsushi', 'Director'], ['Yamada, Minoru', 'Sound Director'], ['Takashima, Daisuke', 'Episode Director']]
