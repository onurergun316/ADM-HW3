Buzzer Beater	TV	13	02/05/2005	02/05/2005	13449	6.54	5634	5906	4708	Hideyoshi is a homeless boy living in New York in the near future, who survives by hustling other kids in basketball games. But now he's been drafted into a pro team-a pro team with a very unique goal. There once was a time when humans dominated the game of basketball. But times have changed, and now the physically superior alien players have taken over the game, and there are barely any human players left. But Hideyoshi's team-the first all-human team to compete in the Space League-intends to change all that, and bring the championship back home to Earth.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Buzzer Beater', 'Sequel: Buzzer Beater 2nd Season']	['Hideyoshi', 'Ivan', 'Cha-Che', 'DT', 'Han', 'Maru', 'Mo', 'Rose', 'Lazuli', 'Murdoch, Liz']	['Takimoto, Fujiko', 'Inada, Tetsu', 'Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Nakao, Ryusei', 'Kosugi, Juurouta', 'Nakata, Jouji', 'Fujita, Daisuke', 'Asakawa, Yuu', 'Katsuki, Masako']	[['Miya, Shigeyuki', 'Director, Character Design'], ['Namura, Hidetoshi', 'Episode Director, Animation Director'], ['Tonokatsu, Hideki', 'Episode Director'], ['Ooba, Hideaki', 'Storyboard']]
