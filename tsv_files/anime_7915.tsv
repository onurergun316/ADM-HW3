Wanpaku Oomukashi Kum Kum	TV	26	10/03/1975	10/03/1975	647	6.15	153	7918	12280	"This is the tale of Kum Kum, a kind of prehistoric ""Dennis the Menace"" who lived long ago. He and his family and friends belonged to a tribe of Mountain People who lived and hunted and farmed high in the hills near the Fire Mountain.This is a comedy series earmarked by infectious chibi-cuteness mixed with the pathos of every-day prehistoric life. The storylines revolves around the adventures of Kum Kum (pronounced coom-coom) and his young friends. Kum Kum has a real knack for getting himself (and the other kids) in trouble and that's what makes the series fun!(Source: kumkum.8thman.com)"	...
