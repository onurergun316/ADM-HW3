Yanoya	NA	1	05/15/2011	-	186		0	14426	16355	"In 2011, Japanese musician Akiko Yano collaborated with students at Tokyo University of the Arts for a school festival. The origin of the project name ""Yanoya"" comes from the desire to have a festival-like character. Some of the works included artwork, a game demo, musical performance, and stage performance. This entry covers ShiShi Yamazaki's contribution to the event, which is believed to be the only work that was animated."	 	[]	[]
