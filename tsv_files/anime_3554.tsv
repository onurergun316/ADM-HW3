Vampire Hunter D	Movie	1	12/21/1985	-	70272	7.06	39227	3556	2034	10,000 years in the future, the world has become a very different place; monsters roam the land freely, and people, although equipped with high tech weapons and cybernetic horses, live a humble life more suited to centuries past. The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Vampire Hunter D', 'Sequel: Vampire Hunter D (2000)']	['D', 'Lang, Doris', 'Left Hand', 'Rei-Ginsei', 'Lee, Magnus', 'Lee, Ramika', 'Greco', 'Lang, Dan']	['Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Tomizawa, Michie', 'Nagai, Ichiro', 'Sogabe, Kazuyuki', 'Katou, Seizou', 'Kitou, Satoko', 'Yara, Yuusaku', 'Toda, Keiko']	[['Ashida, Toyoo', 'Director'], ['Matsuura, Noriyoshi', 'Sound Director'], ['Wyner, Tom', 'Script'], ['Hirano, Yasushi', 'Script']]
