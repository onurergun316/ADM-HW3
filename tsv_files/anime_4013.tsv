Digimon Savers	TV	48	04/02/2006	04/02/2006	77749	6.94	43644	4015	1921	"Upon meeting for the first time, undefeated street fighter Marcus Damon and renegade Digimon Agumon become friends in the most natural way possible for the knuckleheaded duoâ€”by fighting their hearts out. The self-proclaimed ""ultimate team"" are recruited by a secret government organization called the Digimon Data Squad, or DATS, who had witnessed an unbelievable human fighting blow for blow with a Digimon. Their primary objective is investigating mysterious problems caused by Digimon entering the real world, and the world is currently in the midst of a crisis with Digimon appearing at an unprecedented rate. Embarking on various missions with DATS, Marcus and Agumon become colleagues with adolescent genius Thomas H. Norstein and his Digimon partner Gaoman, along with the kind-hearted Yoshino ""Yoshi"" Fujeda and her Digimon partner Lalamon. As the group continues to investigate the rapid increase of Digimon in their world, a darker truth begins to surface, and it is up to Marcus, Agumon, and their friends to get to the bottom of things.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Spin-off: Digimon Adventure', 'Side story: Digimon Savers the Movie: Kyuukyoku Power!
