Happy☆Lesson	OVA	5	07/19/2001	07/19/2001	10687	6.61	4222	5567	5164	One guy. Five girls. One roof. It's a recycled idea, but it never gets old. Happy Lesson is a kinetic take on an old genre.Chitose shares his house with five ladies. One might think the continued attention of this many girls would be a good thing, but too much attention can prove to be painful. Did I mention they're also instructors at his school (hence the title)? Not only is he the subject of their abuse at home, but at school as well. Even when things finally calm down at night, all the rooms are taken so Chitose must sleep on the couch.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Happy★Lesson: Mama Sensei wa Saikou!', 'Alternative version: Happy☆Lesson (TV)']	['Ninomai, Kisaragi', 'Ichimonji, Mutsuki', 'Hitotose, Chitose', 'Sanzenin, Yayoi', 'Shitenno, Uzuki', 'Gokajou, Satsuki', 'Togakushi, Kanna', 'Rokumatsuri, Minazuki', 'Yazakura, Hazuki', 'Nanakorobi, Fumitsuki']	['Kimura, Akiko', 'Asano, Ruri', 'Kishio, Daisuke', 'Inoue, Kikuko', 'Koyama, Kimiko', 'Sasajima, Kaoru', 'Mizuki, Nana', 'Sonozaki, Mie', 'Shima, Ryouka']	[['Oomiya, Saburou', 'Producer'], ['Tonokatsu, Hideki', 'Director'], ['Hoshikawa, Takafumi', 'Director'], ['Inoue, Kikuko', 'Theme Song Performance']]
