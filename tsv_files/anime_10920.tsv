However, the one who appeared before him was Kichou, a 14-year-old girl who proclaims herself as his wife. Appears to have arrived from the Sengoku era, she mistakes Nobunaga as Nobunaga Oda and urges him to conceive a child with her. Thus begins the age-difference love comedy between a gal game-loving teacher and a Sengoku era expert princess.(Source: MAL News)"	['Adaptation: Nobunaga-sensei no Osanazuma']	['Saitou, Kichou', 'Ikoma, Kitsuno', 'Oda, Nobunaga', 'Hoshigaoka, Yuri', 'Biwajima, Mayu', 'Atsuta, Ranma']	['Uehara, Akari', 'Ozawa, Ari', 'Sakai, Koudai', 'Tanaka, Marika', 'Yuuzaki, Konomi']	[['Sasaki, Tokihiro', 'Director'], ['Abe, Nobuyuki', 'Sound Director'], ['Kuramori, Rokurou', 'Episode Director'], ['Tachibana, Rika', 'Theme Song Performance']]
