Battle Programmer Shirase	TV	15	10/04/2003	10/04/2003	31701	6.92	14563	4089	3197	Battle Programmer Shirase, also known as BPS, is a free programmer with super hacking abilities who doesn't work for money. What he does work for is certainly something that only people like him would appreciate. But, his demeanor certainly doesn't suit the jobs he is hired for. With the evil King of America causing trouble via the internet, Shirase is nothing but busy as each new adventure brings even more interesting people into the picture.(Source: ANN)	...
