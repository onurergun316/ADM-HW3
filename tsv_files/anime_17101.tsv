Ma-eum-uisoli	TV	26	07/19/2016	07/19/2016	24		0	17107	18683	While it may seem like a mere depiction of everyday life, The Sound of Your Heart is a comedy filled to the brim with wit, sarcasm, and parody. It gives no regard for the probable or realistic- it is a series of absurd situations that is sure to get a laugh out of every reader willing to suspend their sense of reality.(Source: LINE Webtoon)	['Adaptation: The Sound of Your Heart']	NA	NA	NA
