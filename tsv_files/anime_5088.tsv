Hikari to Mizu no Daphne Specials	Special	2	04/23/2004	04/23/2004	3024	6.7	1281	5091	8357	Two bonus episodes that take place during the course of the series, approximately halfway through it seems. They are entitled 'Everything you always wanted to know about Nereids (but were afraid to ask)' and 'Heaven can wait for Maia Mizuki'. These stories are more lighthearted and comedic in tone, bordering on silly.	['Parent story: Hikari to Mizu no Daphne']	['Mizuki, Maia', 'Gloria', 'Honjo, Rena', 'Park, Yu', 'Hayama, Shizuka']	[]	[['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Otani, Kow', 'Music']]
