One of the poems submitted by mentally-impaired Megumi Ichimura had a melody added by classically trained Japanese violinist Ikuko Kawai. Accompanied by singer Emiko Shiratori, their song titled Obaachan Moshikashite aired on the Minna no Uta program in April, 2005. The video features a blend of live scenery and animation by Seiichi Hayashi.	...	[]	[]	NA
