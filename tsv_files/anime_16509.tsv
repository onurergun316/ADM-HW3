Kaijuu ga Yattekuru	NA	1	10/04/1967	-	162		0	16515	16782	"Animals at a zoo hear that a kaijuu is coming. Like a game of ""Telephone"" they hear bits and pieces of what the kaijuu looks like which gets distorted each time the information is passed on. In the end, it was just a normal zoo animal joining the exhibits."	 	[]	[]
