But even during peaceful periods of time, there is bound to be chaos! As Atsushi, his friends, and the agency's rival group—the Port Mafia—go about their days roaming the streets of Yokohama, there are no limits to the strange situations they are unwillingly thrown into. A new take on its original work, Bungou Stray Dogs Wan! shows the more mundane yet hilarious aspects of the characters' lives.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!', 'Other: Bungou Stray Dogs']	['Dazai, Osamu', 'Akutagawa, Ryuunosuke', 'Nakajima, Atsushi', 'Nakahara, Chuuya', 'Edogawa, Ranpo', 'Oda, Sakunosuke', 'Izumi, Kyouka', 'Yosano, Akiko', 'Kunikida, Doppo', 'Miyazawa, Kenji']	['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Ono, Kensho', 'Uemura, Yuuto', 'Taniyama, Kishou', 'Morohoshi, Sumire', 'Shimamura, Yuu', 'Hosoya, Yoshimasa', 'Kagura, Hiroyuki']	[['Kikuchi, Toshihiro', 'Director'], ['Uemura, Yuuto', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Luck Life', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Harukawa35', 'Original Character Design']]
