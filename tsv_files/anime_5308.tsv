Sensei no Ojikan: Doki Doki School Hours	TV	13	04/05/2004	04/05/2004	7581	6.66	2610	5311	5929	Meet Suzuki Mika, teacher at Okitsu High School. Mika-sensei is a good teacher, but she has a small problem... literally. Although she's 27, she is only 148 cm tall, and has the face of a child. As a result, it is often difficult for Mika-sensei to get anyone to take her seriously.
