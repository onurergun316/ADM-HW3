The film centers on Koko, a boy who was raised by Pokémon and also considers himself as one, treating the Mythical Pokémon Zarude as his father. Ash and Pikachu encounter Koko during an adventure. The film focuses on the theme of a ""human raised by Pokémon,"" instead of the previous films' focus of the ""bond between a human trainer and their Pokémon.""(Source: ANN)"	['Alternative setting: Pokemon', 'Prequel: Pokemon Movie 21: Minna no Monogatari']	['Pikachu', 'Satoshi', 'Zarude', 'Kojirou', 'Musashi', 'Nyarth', 'Hanako', 'Narrator']	['Ootani, Ikue', 'Matsumoto, Rica', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Inuyama, Inuko', 'Horiuchi, Kenyuu']	[['Yajima, Tetsuo', 'Director, Screenplay'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Beverly', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Okazaki, Taiiku', 'Theme Song Composition, Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Arrangement, Inserted Song Performance']]
