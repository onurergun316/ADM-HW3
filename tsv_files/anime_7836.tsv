Gegege no Kitarou: Obake Nighter	Movie	1	03/08/1997	-	780	6.17	180	7839	11792	Like the other 1990s Kitaro mini-movies, this is a remake of a story that’s already been done in the anime, but like every Kitaro remake this is a very different take on the story. In this case it’s a remake of the baseball story that was featured in the very first episode of the original series from 1968.(Source: TSHS)	['Alternative version: Gegege no Kitarou (1968)', 'Parent story: Gegege no Kitarou (1996)']	['Kitarou', 'Medama Oyaji', 'Neko Musume', 'Nezumi Otoko', 'Babaa, Sunakake']	['Matsuoka, Youko', 'Tanonaka, Isamu', 'Nishimura, Chinami', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Yamamoto, Keiko']	[['Satou, Junichi', 'Director'], ['Izumi, Taku', 'Theme Song Composition'], ['Wada, Kaoru', 'Music'], ['Shimada, Michiru', 'Screenplay']]
