Wagamama High Spec	TV	12	04/12/2016	04/12/2016	31176	5.39	12050	10694	3227	The adorable girls of Ousui Academy's student council love to spend time with their crush, Kouki Narumi. But what happens when he isn't around? For the student council, consisting of otaku president Kaoruko Rokuonji; headstrong Ashe Rufflette Sakuragi; quiet computer programmer Toa Narumi; and Toa's best friend, the impish Mihiro Miyase, it means they will have to keep themselves entertained. Wagamama High Spec offers a glimpse into the girls' lives as they get into amusing—and sometimes risqué—hijinks at their school and around town.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	...
