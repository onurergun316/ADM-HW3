Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou	TV	26	10/02/1998	10/02/1998	189401	7.6	66881	1304	945	Yukino Miyazawa is the female representative for her class and the most popular girl among the freshmen at her high school. Good at both academics and sports on top of being elegant and sociable, she has been an object of admiration all her life. However, in reality, she is an incredibly vain person who toils relentlessly to maintain her good grades, athleticism, and graceful appearance. She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praiseâ€”which is why she cannot stand Soichiro Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her. Since the first day of high school, she has struggled to steal the spotlight from her new rival but to no avail.At last, on the midterm exams, Yukino gets the top score and beats Soichiro. But, to her surprise, he congratulates her on her achievement, leading her to question her deceptive lifestyle. When Soichiro confesses his love to Yukino, she turns him down and gloats about it at home with only a hint of regret. But the very next day, Soichiro visits Yukino house to bring her a CD and sees her uninhibited self in action; now equipped with the truth, he blackmails her into completing his student council duties. Coerced into spending time with Soichiro, Yukino learns that she is not the only one hiding secrets.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou']	['Miyazawa, Yukino', 'Arima, Souichirou', 'Shibahime, Tsubasa', 'Asaba, Hideaki', 'Pero Pero', 'Izawa, Maho', 'Ikeda, Kazuma', 'Miyazawa, Hiroyuki', 'Sena, Rika', 'Sawada, Aya']	['Enomoto, Atsuko', 'Suzuki, Chihiro', 'Shintani, Mayumi', 'Kisaichi, Atsushi', 'Noda, Junko', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Kusao, Takeshi', 'Fukui, Yukari', 'Motoya, Yukiko']	[['Tsurumaki, Kazuya', 'Co-Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation, Animation Director'], ['Kobayashi, Noriko', 'Producer'], ['Kamimura, Yasuhiro', 'Producer'], ['Masayuki', 'Assistant Producer, Director of Photography, Key Animation']]
