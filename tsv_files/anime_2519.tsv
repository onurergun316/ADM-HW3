Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor	TV	25	07/05/2004	07/05/2004	42981	7.28	12826	2521	2692	Tatsumiyajima is the central island in the middle of a small cluster of islands, in a sleepy backwater of the Japanese isles. Not much happens there, and the island's young people go to school knowing that their lives are likely to remain peaceful and undisturbed. Or so they have been taught... but the truth is different. The fate of mankind is on the line, and Tatsumiyajima is the last line of defense against a hostile and incomprehensible enemy. At the center of it all, fighting for Humanity's continued existence, is the giant robot Fafner, the dragon that guards this final treasure of mankind.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor', 'Prequel: Soukyuu no Fafner: Right of Left - Single Program', 'Sequel: Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Heaven and Earth', 'Summary: Soukyuu no Fafner: Arcadian Memory', 'Other: Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - The Beyond']	['Minashiro, Soushi', 'Toomi, Maya', 'Makabe, Kazuki', 'Memphis, Kanon', 'Minashiro, Tsubaki', 'Kasugai, Kouyou', 'Tatekami, Seri', 'Hazama, Shouko', 'Kaname, Sakura', 'Tezuka, Kazuhira']	['Kiyasu, Kohei', 'Matsumoto, Marika', 'Ishii, Makoto', 'Kobayashi, Sanae', 'Nakanishi, Tamaki', 'Irino, Miyu', 'Fukuen, Misato', 'Matsuki, Miyu', 'Arai, Satomi', 'Shingaki, Tarusuke']	[['Nakanishi, Go', 'Producer'], ['Noto, Takashi', 'Producer'], ['Habara, Nobuyoshi', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director']]
