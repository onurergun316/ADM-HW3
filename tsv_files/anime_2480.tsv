Boku no Hero Academia: Training of the Dead	OVA	1	06/02/2017	-	166031	7.28	84408	2483	1066	Returning from their internships, the students of Class 1-A are immediately thrown into more training by their homeroom teacher, Shouta Aizawa. For this exercise, the class will be joining four students from Isamu Academy High School to compete in a survival game. Split up into groups of four, students must either eliminate each other or stay hidden until time runs out to win. The training also acts as a reunion between Tsuyu Asui and her friend from middle school, Habuko Mongoose. However, not all the students from Isamu are friendlyâ€”Katsuki Bakugou almost instantly picks a fight with Romero Fujimi. The conflict between the two leads Romero to angrily release his Quirk, a gas which zombifies anyone it comes in contact with. How will the remaining students deal with the situation after most of the people around them turn into zombies?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Parent story: Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season']	['Midoriya, Izuku', 'Asui, Tsuyu', 'Todoroki, Shouto', 'Bakugou, Katsuki', 'All Might', 'Aizawa, Shouta', 'Kirishima, Eijirou', 'Uraraka, Ochako', 'Kaminari, Denki', 'Tokoyami, Fumikage']	['Yamashita, Daiki', 'Yuuki, Aoi', 'Kaji, Yuki', 'Okamoto, Nobuhiko', 'Miyake, Kenta', 'Suwabe, Junichi', 'Masuda, Toshiki', 'Sakura, Ayane', 'Hatanaka, Tasuku', 'Hosoya, Yoshimasa']	[['Horikoshi, Kouhei', 'Original Creator'], ['Kawakami, Nobuhiko', 'Key Animation']]
