Rokudenashi Blues	Movie	1	07/11/1992	-	1779	5.78	418	9443	9756	Maeda is a new student in the Teiken High School. He stutters when he's nervous and he's rather clumsy. He gets noted immediately because he hits a teacher during the entrance ceremony. Some clubs search to enlist him as they see in him a force they can use to get even with other clubs. But Maeda is a loner and has only one dream: becoming a boxing champion.(Source: MU)	['Adaptation: Rokudenashi Blues', 'Sequel: Rokudenashi Blues 1993']	['Maeda, Taison', 'Hatanaka, Yuutarou', 'Imai, Kazumi', 'Nanase, Chiaki', 'Yamashita, Katsuji', 'Sawamura, Yoneji']	['Hori, Hideyuki']	[['Suga, Yoshiyuki', 'Script'], ['Morita, Masanori', 'Original Creator'], ['Aoyama, Mitsuru', 'Key Animation'], ['Nishiyama, Shigeru', 'Editing']]
