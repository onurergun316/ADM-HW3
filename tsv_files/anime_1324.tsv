Sixteen-year-old student Banagher Links visits the Industrial 7 space colony on a school field trip, but because of a broken shuttle, he is left completely stranded. To Banagher, who has always lived a normal life, war had always been a distant, almost mythical part of history; but within minutes, fantasy becomes reality when he rescues a girl named Audrey Burne, who urgently needs to meet with the leader of the nearby Vist Foundation, Cardeas Vist. She hopes to persuade him to withhold the ""Laplace's Box,"" an object that holds the potential to destroy the world. History is set in motion as galactic forces converge on Industrial 7, each vying for possession of the Laplace's Box. As Neo Zeon remnants clash with Earth Federation Forces around the colony, Cardeas, in his final moments, gives Banagher the key to the Box, a mobile suit dubbed ""The Unicorn Gundam.""Packed with explosive action and rising tension, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:0096 follows Banagher as his conviction is tested and the destiny that has laid dormant for more than a century is finally realized.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Kidou Senshi Gundam Unicorn', 'Alternative version: Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn', 'Other: Re:I Am']	['Links, Banagher', 'Frontal, Full', 'Zabi, Mineva Lao', 'Noa, Bright', 'Cruz, Marida', 'Haro', 'Shiden, Kai', 'Zinnerman, Suberoa', 'Sauper, Angelo', 'Mackle, Daguza']	['Uchiyama, Kouki', 'Ikeda, Shuuichi', 'Fujimura, Ayumi', 'Narita, Ken', 'Kaida, Yuuko', 'Hirohashi, Ryou', 'Furukawa, Toshio', 'Tezuka, Hideaki', 'Kakihara, Tetsuya', 'Touchi, Hiroki']	[['Furuhashi, Kazuhiro', 'Director'], ['Kimura, Eriko', 'Sound Director'], ['Mutou, Yasuyuki', 'Script'], ['Aimer', 'Theme Song Performance']]
