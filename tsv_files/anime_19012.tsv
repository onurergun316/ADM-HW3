Star☆Jewel Gaiden: Natsumi Oblivion	OVA	1	03/22/2012	-	2268	5.06	691		9105	A war is being fought between the goddesses of dark and light. While the former try to steal the jewels from innocent women, leaving lifeless husks, the latter hunt the evildoers. Both types of goddesses are equipped with powers to fight, but their strongest weapons are their retractable penises—flooding the enemy with pleasure is the only sure-fire way to win.(Source: AniDB)	['Parent story: Star☆Jewel']	['Kanno, Natsumi', 'Kanna, Reiko', 'Ten, Armand', 'Soloviev, Juni', 'Kanzaka, Mei']	['Narumi, Erika', 'Kasuga, An']
