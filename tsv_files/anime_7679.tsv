Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau! Sendai Kokeshi Enka	OVA	6	09/14/1990	09/14/1990	800	6.2	125	7682	11711	"Shoko and Maiko Ougi are apparently two ordinary schoolgirls in pursuit of graduating and having fun. Shii-chan is the more serious while Mai-chan is more fun-loving. In reality, the two sisters are powerful exorcists from the Karura temple. Each wields half the power... Shii-chan can ""see"" the spirits, and Mai-chan can banish them. This is a spooky series with heavy emphasis on traditionally Japanese occult themes.
