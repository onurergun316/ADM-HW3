Kujira no Chouyaku	Movie	1	11/14/1998	-	7695	6.63	3255	5466	5892	Time has come to a standstill. A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies. What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.(Source: ANN)	['Alternative version: A Piece of Phantasmagoria']	['Narrator']	[]	[['Shionaga, Atsuo', 'Producer'], ['Tamura, Shigeru', 'Director, Theme Song Lyrics, Creator'], ['Ogasawara, Hiroshi', 'Music']]
