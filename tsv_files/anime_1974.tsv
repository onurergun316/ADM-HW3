Nichijou: Nichijou no 0-wa	OVA	1	03/12/2011	-	74453	7.4	39642	1976	1968	While the title suggests a story of simple, everyday school life, the contents are more the opposite. The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot's arm hide a rollcake. However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn't study for.
