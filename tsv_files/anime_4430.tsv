Juushin Enbu: Hero Tales	TV	26	10/08/2007	10/08/2007	24551	6.85	8591	4432	3630	For citizens of the Ken Empire, justice is a myth. Lord Keiro, the deranged Shogun of the Imperial Army, blazes a trail of terror across the countryside in search of the sacred sword that will make him a god. Standing in his way is Taito, an omnipotent star reborn in human formâ€”a young hero who vows to use his celestial strength to avenge those slaughtered by the villainous Shogun.Taito's mystical powers steer him toward a violent showdown with Keiro, and if used recklessly, his newfound abilities could shred the very fabric of his being. To master the art of control and become a heroic martial artist, Taito must seek the guidance of others like him: the seven star-born warriors with the strength to shatter a corrupt empire.(Source: RightStuf)	['Adaptation: Juushin Enbu']	['Shirei, Taitou', 'Mouten, Ryuukou', 'Meitoku, Housei', 'Seiren, Laila', 'Mougai, Koyo', 'Shokan, Rinmei', 'Hakuho, Keiro', 'Kuju, Kouei', 'Choyo, Shoukaku', 'Taki']	['Suzumura, Kenichi', 'Sakurai, Takahiro', 'Tai, Yuuki', 'Kanda, Akemi', 'Koyama, Rikiya', 'Kaida, Yuuko', 'Ginga, Banjou', 'Tanaka, Atsuko', 'Hayami, Show', 'Orikasa, Fumiko']	[['Sekita, Osamu', 'Director'], ['Shimizu, Youji', 'Sound Director'], ['Asami, Matsuo', 'Episode Director'], ['High and Mighty Color', 'Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics']]
