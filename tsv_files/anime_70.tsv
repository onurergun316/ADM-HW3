As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family.Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society. Wolf Children is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki', 'Other: Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki x House Shokuhin Stew CM']	['Hana', 'Ame', 'Yuki', 'Ookami', 'Fujii, Souhei', 'Nirasaki', 'Shino', 'Horita', 'Fujii, Mother', 'Keno']	['Miyazaki, Aoi', 'Nishii, Yukito', 'Kuroki, Haru', 'Osawa, Takao', 'Hiraoka, Takuma', 'Sugawara, Bunta', 'Kobayashi, Rino', 'Aso, Kumiko', 'Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Kamishiraishi, Mone']	[['Saitou, Yuuichirou', 'Producer'], ['Inoue, Shinichiro', 'Producer'], ['Hosoda, Mamoru', 'Director, Theme Song Lyrics, Original Creator, Screenplay'], ['Okudera, Satoko', 'Script']]
