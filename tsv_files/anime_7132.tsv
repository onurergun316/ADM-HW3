Busou Shinki	TV	12	10/05/2012	10/05/2012	34967	6.31	11633	7135	3034	"The slice-of-life battle story is set in a future that has neither World War III nor an alien invasionâ€”just an ordinary future set after our current age. In this world, robots are part of everyday life, and they contribute in various aspects of society. ""Shinki"" are 15-centimeter-tall (about 6-inch-tall) cute partners made to assist humans. Equipped with intelligence and emotions, they devote themselves to serving their ""Masters.""These Shinki can even be equipped with weapons and armor to fight each other. Such Shinki are named ""Busou Shinki"" (literally, ""armed divine princesses""). In particular, the Shinki Ann (Arnval), Aines (Altines), and Lene (Altlene) serve a high school freshman named Masato. Things change when a new Shinki, the bellicose Strarf, joins them.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Busou Shinki', 'Other: Busou Shinki Moon Angel', 'Sequel: Busou Shinki: Install x Dream']	['Arnval Mk.2', 'Strarf Mk.2', 'Altlene', 'Altines', 'Rihito', 'Zelnogrard', 'Fubuki', 'Tsugaru', 'Zielbellen', 'Jindou']	['Asumi, Kana', 'Chihara, Minori', 'Nakajima, Megumi', 'Mizuhashi, Kaori', 'Mizushima, Takahiro', 'Shiraishi, Ryouko', 'Fukui, Yukari', 'Kugimiya, Rie', 'Taketatsu, Ayana', 'Kamiya, Hiroshi']	[['Kikuchi, Yasuhito', 'Director'], ['Iida, Satoki', 'Sound Director'], ['Egami, Kiyoshi', 'Episode Director'], ['Matsuda, Kiyoshi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
