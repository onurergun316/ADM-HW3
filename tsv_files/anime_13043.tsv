Within kamizumo matches, the gods are powered through the drumbeats struck by their oyakata, which forces Dai to pick up the mallets once more.As the duo slowly racks up victories, Dai confronts his self-doubts and reignites his passion in the new endeavor to stand on kamizumo's topmost stage.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	 	['Goutetsu', 'Mugen, Dai', 'Broadron', 'Bassha', 'Ayama, Runa', 'Sonozaki, Susumu', 'Kishi, Kaisei', 'Tanba, Rin']	['Shin, Yuuki', 'Urushiyama, Yuuki', 'Tada, Keita', 'Yokojima, Wataru', 'Horikoshi, Sena', 'Yamaoka, Yuri', 'Ohtsu, Airi', 'Mineda, Mayu']	[['Satou, Mitsutoshi', 'Director'], ['Nakano, Tooru', 'Sound Director'], ['Kabumoto, Hideaki', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Horikoshi, Sena', 'Theme Song Performance']]
