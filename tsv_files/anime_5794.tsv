Gun Frontier	TV	13	03/28/2002	03/28/2002	9007	6.56	3043	5797	5539	It is a harsh and barren wasteland, where the weak aren't allowed to dream. It is also a sacred land for true men, for there is no place a man can feel more alive. This is the Gun Frontier. Sea Pirate Captain Harlock and the errant samurai, Tochiro arrive in the United States on the Western Frontier. Along with a mysterious woman they meet along the way, the two friends challenge sex rings, bandits, and corrupt sheriff. They are searching for a lost clan of Japanese immigrants, and they will tear Gun Frontier from end to end until they find it.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Gun Frontier', 'Alternative setting: Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Herlock']	['Captain Herlock', 'Ooyama, Tochirou', 'Shinunora', 'Ganman', 'Sanae', 'Katarina', 'Hana', 'Ayame', 'Yoneko', 'Asaka']	['Takemoto, Eiji', 'Yamaguchi, Kappei', 'Matsumoto, Rica', 'Sakuta, Osamu', 'Shindo, Naomi', 'Shindo, Naomi', 'Hirohashi, Ryou', 'Ohta, Shiori', 'Touma, Yumi', 'Kakazu, Yumi']	[['Hayase, Hiroyuki', 'Sound Director'], ['Teramoto, Yukiyo', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Araki, Kenichi', 'Script'], ['Tsujihata, Tetsuya', 'Theme Song Composition']]
