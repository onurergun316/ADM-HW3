Some types of Zoids, know as Organoids, are miniature Zoids that are living organisms. These Organoids have the capability to fuse with a non-living Zoid and make it much more powerful.Van (Ban) Freiheit discovers a Zoid Organoid in an abandoned laboratory while running from two strangers piloting Zoids. Also in the laboratory, in an animated suspension tube is a strange girl. He breaks the tube open and takes her and the Organoid with him. Spotting a ruined Shield Liger Zoid outside nearby, the Organoid fuses with it and repairs the damages. Making his escape, Van names the Organoid Zeke, and decides to keep him as a friend. The girl, who says her name is Fiona, wants to find something called Zoids Eve, and so Van, Zeke, and Fiona begin their adventure.(Source: AniDB)	['Adaptation: Kijuushin Seiki Zoids', 'Spin-off: Zoids Genesis', 'Other: Zoids Wild']	['Flyheight, Van', 'Linette, Elisi', 'Prozen, Gunther', 'Raven', 'Irvine', 'Schubaltz, Karl', 'Reese', 'Moonbay', 'Shadow', 'Schubaltz, Thomas Richard']	['Kishio, Daisuke', 'Ohmoto, Makiko', 'Saiga, Mitsuki', 'Fujiwara, Keiji', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Watanabe, Kumiko']	[['Kato, Takao', 'Director'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Ootsuki, Atsushi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Habara, Nobuyoshi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation']]
