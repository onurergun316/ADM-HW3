Dejected after losing to his kendo rival, Shuu climbs a smokestack to watch the sunset where he finds Lala-Ru, a quiet, blue-haired girl wearing a strange pendant. Shuu attempts to befriend her, despite her uninterested, bland responses.However, his hopes are crushed when a woman, accompanied by two serpentine machines, appear out of thin air with one goal in mind: capture Lala-Ru. Shuu, bull-headed as he is, tries to save his new friend from her kidnappers and is transported to a desert world, unlike anything he has ever seen before. Yet, despite the circumstances, Shuu only thinks of saving Lala-Ru, until he is thoroughly beaten up by some soldiers. As he soon finds out, Lala-Ru can manipulate water and her pendant is the source from which she is able to bring forth the liquid, a scarce commodity in his new environment. But now, the pendant is lost, and Shuu is the prime suspect.Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku is the haunting story of a dystopian world, and of Shuu, who has to endure torture, hunger, and the horrors of war in order to save the lonely girl he found sitting atop a smokestack.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	 	['Matsutani, Shuuzou', 'Lala-Ru', 'Ringwalt, Sara', 'Nabuca', 'Hamdo', 'Sis', 'Boo', 'Soon', 'Abelia', 'Kazam']	['Okamura, Akemi', 'Nazuka, Kaori', 'Nakao, Azusa', 'Imai, Yuka', 'Ishii, Kouji', 'Matsumoto, Rica', 'Konishi, Hiroko', 'Saitou, Ayaka', 'Yasuhara, Reiko', 'Matsuyama, Takashi']	[['Daichi, Akitarou', 'Director, Script, Storyboard, Original Creator'], ['Tanaka, Kazuya', 'Sound Director'], ['Ootsuka, Masahiko', 'Episode Director'], ['Hiramatsu, Tadashi', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
