The towers are also home to the Alamos Town Contest Hall, which is the next destination for Hikari, Satoshi, and Takeshi in their journey through the Sinnoh region. A woman named Alice and her partner Chimchar are happy to guide Satoshi and his friends through the town and its hallmarks.But the tour is suddenly interrupted when Alice's friend Tonio notices a wave of dimensional disturbances throughout the town—all of which is blamed on an ominous Pokémon named Darkrai. The space-time disturbances continue to intensify as two legendary Pokémon, the Temporal Pokémon Dialga and the Spatial Pokémon Palkia, appear to duel each other, isolating the town and everyone present in it from the world into another dimension!As he learns that this event was foreseen long ago, Tonio finds that his great-grandfather left behind a way to stop the dueling Pokémon. Will Satoshi and his friends be able to use this last resort to save Alamos Town from vaporizing between the dimensions?[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Gekijouban Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl: Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai', 'Parent story: Pokemon Diamond & Pearl']	['Pikachu', 'Satoshi', 'Takeshi', 'Hikari', 'Musashi', 'Darkrai', 'Alice', 'Baron Alberto', 'Kojirou', 'Nyarth']	['Ootani, Ikue', 'Matsumoto, Rica', 'Ueda, Yuuji', 'Toyoguchi, Megumi', 'Hayashibara, Megumi', 'Ishizaka, Kouji', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Inuyama, Inuko']	[['Yuyama, Kunihiko', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director'], ['Sonoda, Hideki', 'Script'], ['Valencia, Amparo', 'Script, ADR Director']]
