In the old days they'd go off into the country and hack each other up with swords, but these days, what with school, that isn't very practical.So some of them do something very un-Japanese. They strap on a big bike, roar around annoying people, and pound anyone they consider dishonorable.Now meet Eguchi Yousuke, leader of a high-school Biker gang AND the school's handicrafts club. Which means he divides his time between fistfights and fancy needlework.And if you think he's weird, wait until you meet the rest of his gang...(Source: AniDB)"	['Adaptation: Shonan Bakusouzoku']	['Yousuke, Eguchi']	['Shiozawa, Kaneto']	[['Nishizawa, Nobutaka', 'Director, Screenplay'], ['Hound Dog', 'Theme Song Composition, Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Arrangement, Theme Song Lyrics'], ['Mr.Children', 'Theme Song Arrangement, Theme Song Performance'], ['Shou', 'Theme Song Performance, Theme Song Lyrics, Theme Song Composition']]
