Reideen	TV	26	02/04/2007	02/04/2007	8039	6.55	2346	5858	5798	"Saiga is a normal high school student with a gift in mathematics. His daily routine is disrupted when his family gets news that his Father's remains have been discovered—a noted archeologist and researcher who had gone missing while exploring a site many years before. Among his remains were notes and artifacts that needed to be identified by the family near a notable triangular mountain in Japan known as ""Japan's pyramid"", a place suspected by some to be man-made. A meteor containing a strange robotic lifeform falls from the sky and begins to cause destruction, putting Saiga in danger and causing a mysterious bracelet from his father's research to activate and merge him with an ancient robot burried within the pyramid—a robot the runes describe as Reideen. It is now up to Saiga and guardian Reideen to fight against this unknown alien threat from the sky.(Source: ANN)"	['Adaptation: Reideen', 'Spin-off: Chouja Raideen', 'Alternative version: Yuusha Raideen']	['Saiga, Junki', 'Midorino, Akira', 'Maedasaki, Taro', 'Kobayakawa, Shiori', 'Hoshikawa, Hana', 'Roxell', 'Terasaki, Soji']	['Azuma, Masataka', 'Chiba, Saeko', 'Miki, Shinichiro', 'Okada, Yuka', 'Honda, Takako', 'Nojima, Hirofumi', 'Fujiwara, Keiji']	[['Kuroki, Rui', 'Producer'], ['Morishita, Katsuji', 'Producer'], ['Hongou, Mitsuru', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard, Series Composition'], ['Mima, Masafumi', 'Sound Director']]
