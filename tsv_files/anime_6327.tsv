Koro no Dai Sanpo	Special	1	10/01/2001	-	2627	6.47	275	6330	8744	"This is a short film about 15 minutes long, which was shown for a limited time only at the Ghibli Museum. Koro is a puppy owned by a little girl in a small town. One day she leaves the front gate ajar when she goes to school. Koro slips out and wanders the streets of the town. He is picked up by a girl riding a bicycle, but slips away at the level train crossing. He meets a friendly old dog and his kindly owners, while his mistress and her father ride around town putting up ""Lost"" signs on the power poles. Koro eventually falls asleep under a delivery van, whose driver gives him a ride. When he gets near home, Koro smells the familiar neighborhood and leaps out of the truck and into the arms of his delighted mistress."	...	[]	[]	NA
