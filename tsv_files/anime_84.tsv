However, the boon of this lifestyle leaves them unprepared when an unknown, hostile threat arises due to the ever-growing human population. This calamity is the Anti-Spiral—a fearsome enemy with unparalleled power. As the Spiral King's prognosis postulating the destruction of ""The Spiral's World"" begins to come true, the pieces are in place, and Team Dai-Gurren is ready. With his late brother's hope to see a better future for mankind, Simon—along with Nia Teppelin and the rest of the team—is determined to overthrow the mighty Anti-Spiral in order to revive humanity's lost hope.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Alternative version: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann', 'Prequel: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Movie 1: Gurren-hen']	['Simon', 'Teppelin, Nia', 'Kamina', 'Littner, Yoko', 'Viral', 'Bachika, Kittan', 'Boota', 'Littner, Leeron', 'Lordgenome', 'Adai, Rossiu']	['Kakihara, Tetsuya', 'Fukui, Yukari', 'Konishi, Katsuyuki', 'Inoue, Marina', 'Hiyama, Nobuyuki', 'Taniyama, Kishou', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Onosaka, Masaya', 'Ikeda, Narushi', 'Saiga, Mitsuki']	[['Takeda, Yasuhiro', 'Producer'], ['Matsuura, Hiroaki', 'Producer'], ['Imaishi, Hiroyuki', 'Director, Storyboard, Animation Director, Key Animation'], ['Ootsuka, Masahiko', 'Episode Director, Assistant Director']]
