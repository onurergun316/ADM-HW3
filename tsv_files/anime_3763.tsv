Unico: Mahou no Shima e	Movie	1	07/16/1983	-	2528	7.01	1144	3765	8834	"Based on ""Unico and the Kingdom of the Sun,"" which was newly written as a theater version, this animated film features a battle between the wizard Kukuruku and Unico. Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that ""transformation"" or ""transfiguration"" - favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu - involves not only material aspects, but also man's immaterial heart.(Source: Tezuka Osamu's Website)"	['Prequel: Unico']	"['Unico', 'Kukurukku', 'Torby', 'Cherry', 'Zephyrus', ""Cherry's Father"", ""Cherry's Mother"", 'Mars', 'Yamaneko', 'Mokuba']"	['Miwa, Katsue', 'Tokita, Fujio', 'Ikeda, Shuuichi', 'Shimamoto, Sumi', 'Baisho, Chieko', 'Harada, Kazuo', 'Taichi, Kotoe', 'Tsukase, Noriko', 'Nagai, Ichiro', 'Saikachi, Ryuuji']	[['Murano, Moribi', 'Director, Screenplay, Series Composition'], ['Urakami, Yasuo', 'Sound Director'], ['Shiratori, Emiko', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Tezuka, Osamu', 'Original Creator']]
