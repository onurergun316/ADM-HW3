Girls Bravo: First Season	TV	11	07/05/2004	07/05/2004	131176	6.41	63776	6646	1311	Small for his age, Yukinari has been bullied and abused by girls all his life. Now in high school, he has developed a rare condition: whenever girls touch him, or even come close, he breaks out in hives. Imagine his surprise, when he is suddenly transported to the city of Seiren on a mystic world invisibly orbiting the Earth, and populated with vast numbers of women and very few men. Fortunately, he has a new friend, Miharu-chan, whose touch inexplicably doesn't affect him.(Source: ANN)	['Adaptation: Girls Bravo', 'Sequel: Girls Bravo: Second Season']	['Sena Kanaka, Miharu', 'Kojima, Kirie', 'Sasaki, Yukinari', 'Fukuyama, Kazuharu', 'Fukuyama, Risa', 'Ebi', 'Hare Nanaka, Koyomi', 'Kosame', 'Lana Jude, Tomoka', 'Sena Kanaka, Maharu']	['Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Saitou, Chiwa', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Okiayu, Ryoutarou', 'Matsuoka, Yuki', 'Kaneda, Tomoko', 'Kurata, Masayo', 'Masu, Nozomi', 'Saitou, Ayaka', 'Ohara, Sayaka']	[['Aoki, Ei', 'Director'], ['Tsuruoka, Youta', 'Sound Director'], ['Ishihira, Shinji', 'Storyboard'], ['Hayashi, Hiroki', 'Storyboard']]
