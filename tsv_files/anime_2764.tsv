Amagami SS: Tachibana Miya-hen - Imouto	Special	1	04/29/2011	-	49185	7.22	28718	2766	2520	Miya Tachibana, assuming her annoying brother Junichi will be unlucky in love and alone forever, decides to spy on him at school after hearing that some of her friends find him to be kind and caring. Through her spying, she learns that he gets along well with girls at school, which results in an even bigger misunderstanding, as Miya wrongfully assumes he likes men since he doesn't have a girlfriend. However, after she herself rejects a boy, Miya starts questioning how she views Junichi as she is reminded of Junichi's similar experience from two years earlier.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Parent story: Amagami SS']	['Tachibana, Miya', 'Tachibana, Junichi', 'Morishima, Haruka', 'Ayatsuji, Tsukasa', 'Nanasaki, Ai', 'Tanamachi, Kaoru', 'Nakata, Sae', 'Sakurai, Rihoko', 'Kamizaki, Risa', 'Umehara, Masayoshi']	['Asumi, Kana', 'Maeno, Tomoaki', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Nazuka, Kaori', 'Yukana', 'Satou, Rina', 'Konno, Hiromi', 'Shintani, Ryouko', 'Kadowaki, Mai', 'Terashima, Takuma']	[['Asumi, Kana', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['azusa', 'Theme Song Performance'], ['Enterbrain', 'Original Creator'], ['Takayama, Kisai', 'Original Character Design']]
