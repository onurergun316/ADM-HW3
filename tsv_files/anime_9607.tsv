Kikumana	ONA	1	07/14/2001	-	7854	5.74	3990	9610	5845	"This work ""Kikumana"" is an animation of a girl called Kikumana who acts like in a stage performance, the role defeated by such an ill circumstance though she tries to find herself. The primal aim is to get the audience feeling a strange atmosphere spread from this work. The image has a pictorial atmosphere and a documentary touch at the same time. Unrealistic phenomena take place there.(Source: AniDB)"	 	[]	[]
