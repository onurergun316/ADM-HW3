Osomatsu-san Special	Special	1	01/29/2016	-	10839	7.42	5411	1904	5140	"The 1st BD & DVD volume of Osomatsu-san will have a new episode, replacing episode 1 of the original series which was removed due to the fact that it contained multiple parodies. It has been pulled entirely from streaming sites and the Japanese Blu-Ray release. This replacement episode is sometimes numbered ""episode 3.5"" as listed on the home-media release, as it's chronologically placed after episode 3 (originally TV episode 4)."
