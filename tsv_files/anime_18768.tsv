Because he and Otome often hang out together and get along very well, Kazuki believes that it is inevitable that they begin dating. However, Kazuki's little sister, Rinka, is dissatisfied with this possibility because she is secretly in love with him.This innocent relationship takes a dramatic turn when Kazuki receives an untitled DVD showing Otome engaging in sexual activities with elderly men. His despair grows even greater when similar DVDs start arriving on a regular basis. As Kazuki stares in horror at the love of his life being defiled by a group of strangers, he notices Otome's demeanor gradually changing.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Otomedori', 'Other: Mesu Nochi Torare']	['Sakuragi, Otome', 'Okino, Rinka', 'Okino, Kazuki']	['Asakawa, Yuu', 'Igarashi, Hiromi']	[['Nishikawa, Takashi', 'Director, Script, Storyboard, Key Animation, Animation Director, Character Design'], ['Carn', 'Original Creator'], ['Sugibayashi, Yurika', 'Color Design'], ['Sera, Kouta', 'Key Animation']]
