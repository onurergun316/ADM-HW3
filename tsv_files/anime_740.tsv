However, she realizes that she is starting to lose her desire to sparkle, having grown accustomed to the routines of her job. As this was a desire she had when she first moved to the inn, the realization bothers her. While having Yuina Wakura—Ohana's classmate, friend, and the daughter of rival Fukuya Inn's owner—under her as an apprentice, Ohana stumbles upon some old archives that mention her mother, Satsuki. Ohana does not know much about her mother, but these archives could shed some light on her past.Besides learning more about her mother, it is business as usual at Kissui Inn—though with a couple of challenges to test Ohana and the staff of the inn.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Parent story: Hanasaku Iroha']	['Matsumae, Ohana', 'Tsurugi, Minko', 'Oshimizu, Nako', 'Matsumae, Satsuki', 'Wakura, Yuina', 'Shijima, Sui', 'Miyagishi, Tooru', 'Tanemura, Kouichi', 'Sukegawa, Denroku', 'Wajima, Tomoe']	['Itou, Kanae', 'Omigawa, Chiaki', 'Toyosaki, Aki', 'Honda, Takako', 'Tomatsu, Haruka', 'Kubota, Tamie', 'Majima, Junji', 'Kaji, Yuki', 'Cho', 'Noto, Mamiko']	[['Horikawa, Kenji', 'Producer'], ['Andou, Masahiro', 'Director'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director'], ['Anzai, Takefumi', 'Episode Director']]
