Shakugan no Shana	TV	24	10/06/2005	10/06/2005	490442	7.48	231021	1690	333	"The world has become a slaughtering ground for the Crimson Denizens, mysterious beings from a parallel universe who thrive on the life energy of humans. These merciless murderers only leave behind scant remainders of souls called ""Torches,"" which are mere residues that will eventually be destroyed, along with the very fact of the victims' existence from the minds of the living. In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.One fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Shakugan no Shana', 'Spin-off: Shakugan no Shana-tan', 'Side story: Shakugan no Shana: Koi to Onsen no Kougai Gakushuu!', 'Summary: Shakugan no Shana Movie', 'Sequel: Shakugan no Shana II (Second)', 'Character: Dengeki Bunko 2007 Movie Festival Special']	"['Shana', 'Sakai, Yuuji', 'Yoshida, Kazumi', 'Carmel, Wilhelmina', 'Hecate', 'Daw, Margery', ""Nbh'w, Khamsin"", 'Alastor', 'Marchosias', 'Satou, Keisaku']"	['Kugimiya, Rie', 'Hino, Satoshi', 'Kawasumi, Ayako', 'Itou, Shizuka', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Nabatame, Hitomi', 'Minagawa, Junko', 'Ebara, Masashi', 'Iwata, Mitsuo', 'Nojima, Kenji']	[['Kawase, Kouhei', 'Producer'], ['Nakayama, Nobuhiro', 'Producer'], ['Watanabe, Takashi', 'Director, Storyboard'], ['Aketagawa, Jin', 'Sound Director']]
