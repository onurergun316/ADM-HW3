Terra Formars: Revenge	TV	13	04/02/2016	04/02/2016	81715	6.69	40606	5140	1871	In Terra Formars Revenge, the crew members of the Annex I continue to fight against Terraformarsâ€”the large humanoid cockroaches that evolved from the ones sent to Mars centuries ago. However, far from discovering the cure for the lethal Alien Engine Virus that has been plaguing Earth, the Annex I team have learned that some squadrons have agendas from their own countries. Now, the squadrons must not only fight against the Terraformars for their survival, but also each other in the never-ending battle for international dominance.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Terra Formars', 'Prequel: Terra Formars', 'Sequel: Terra Formars: Earth-hen']	['Davis, Michelle K.', 'Hizamaru, Akari', 'Komachi, Shoukichi', 'Asimov, Sylvester', 'Reinhardt, Adolf', 'Newton, Joseph Gustav', 'Onizuka, Keiji', 'Eringrad Garcia, Marcos', 'Asimov, Alexander', 'Sanjou, Kanako']	['Itou, Shizuka', 'Hosoya, Yoshimasa', 'Kiuchi, Hidenobu', 'Ishizuka, Unshou', 'Yusa, Kouji', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Ono, Daisuke', 'Ishikawa, Kaito', 'Nara, Tooru', 'Takahashi, Chiaki']	[['Satomi, Tetsurou', 'Producer'], ['Fukuda, Michio', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation'], ['Yamaguchi, Takayuki', 'Sound Director'], ['Tanaka, Tomoya', 'Episode Director']]
