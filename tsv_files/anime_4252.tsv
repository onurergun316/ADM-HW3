He vows to prove that aliens are real in honor of his late friend. A transfer student named Neko Kuroha unexpectedly arrives one day, bearing a striking resemblance to the late Kuronekoâ€”even sharing a similar name. Most mysteriously, she seems to possess supernatural powers.As Ryouta takes more interest in Neko, he is drawn into a deadly world where dangerous scientists hunt magic-wielding witches that have escaped from their secret research laboratory. Neko is one of these escapees, but there are many others who are in similar situations, and it's up to Ryouta to protect them from their would-be captors.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Gokukoku no Brynhildr', 'Side story: Gokukoku no Brynhildr: Kara Sawagi']	['Kuroha, Neko', 'Schlierenzauer, Kazumi', 'Tachibana, Kana', 'Murakami, Ryouta', 'Takatori, Kotori', 'Tokou, Nanami', 'Fujisaki, Mako', 'Wakabayashi, Hatsuna', 'Hashiratani, Kogorou', 'Ichijiku, Chisato']	['Taneda, Risa', 'Ichimichi, Mao', 'Suzaki, Aya', 'Satou, Rina', 'Tadokoro, Azusa', 'Numakura, Manami', 'Noto, Mamiko', 'Uchiyama, Yumi', 'Itou, Kentarou', 'Touchi, Hiroki']	[['Imaizumi, Kenichi', 'Director'], ['Tsuchiya, Masaki', 'Sound Director'], ['Takamura, Yuuta', 'Episode Director'], ['Kitajima, Yukinori', 'Script, Series Composition']]
