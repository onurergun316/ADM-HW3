Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora	TV	12	07/03/2008	07/03/2008	23909	7.27	6025	2581	3687	Get ready for a second magical journey to the world of Someday's Dreamers, where spellcasting is a profession that requires both the proper training AND a license. It's to get that license and fulfill a promise made to her late father that young Sora Suzuki has made the long journey from her distant home in the countryside town of Biei to the big city of Tokyo. It's a daunting challenge, but she's got a little bit of talent, a charming personality and, most important of all, the promise of an internship! What she ISN'T expecting, though, is how different life in the city will be, especially the people themselves. While she gets along with the confident Asagi, Kuroda and the gentle Hiyori, she's completely confused with the mysterious boy Gouta. And yet, as a result of their internships they keep ending up in the same situations and slowly learning to understand more about each other than they ever imagined possible!(Source: Sentai Filmworks)	['Adaptation: Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora', 'Parent story: Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto']	['Suzuki, Sora', 'Midorikawa, Gouta', 'Asagi, Honomi', 'Kuroda, Kouji', 'Yasuko', 'Shiraishi, Saori', 'Yamabuki, Hiyori', 'Hara, Seiichirou']	['Hanazawa, Kana', 'Maeno, Tomoaki', 'Inoue, Marina', 'Namikawa, Daisuke', 'micc', 'Takano, Urara', 'Takahashi, Mikako', 'Koyama, Rikiya']	[['Matsuda, Akio', 'Producer'], ['Kobayashi, Osamu', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Key Animation, Animation Director'], ['Nagasaki, Yukio', 'Sound Director'], ['Hori, Motonobu', 'Episode Director, Animation Director']]
