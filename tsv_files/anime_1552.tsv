With the company of his friends, Keiichi arrives to Honda Inn, the place indicated on the map. Once the party is inside, they meet Honda Chieko, who seems to share a certain promise with Keiichi. Apart from all that confusion, it's time for Keiichi to have enough courage to say the words ""I love you"" to Belldandy."	['Adaptation: Aa! Megami-sama!', 'Prequel: Aa!
