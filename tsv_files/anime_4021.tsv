Jashin-chan Dropkick	TV	11	07/10/2018	07/10/2018	85173	6.94	28321	4023	1817	The demon Jashin-chan has been summoned to Earth by Yurine Hanazono, a girl with a knack for the occult. Unfortunately, Yurine does not actually know how to send Jashin-chan back to Hell. Now stuck on Earth, she must live at Yurine's apartment as her familiar.The only way for Jashin-chan to return would be to kill her summoner, but this is easier said than done for the incompetent demon. Since Jashin-chan is immortal and can regenerate her body, Yurine does not hold back in attacking her with a range of weapons, punishing her in gruesome manners for her evil schemes. Jashin-chan is also often visited by her demon friends: the kindhearted Gorgon Medusa and the energetic minotaur Minosu, who seem much more well-behaved in contrast, and disapprove of her plans to kill Yurine.Jashin-chan Dropkick is a comedy focusing on these two reluctant roommates and their bizarre antics as they get by with their cat-and-mouse relationship.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	"['Adaptation: Jashin-chan Dropkick', 'Sequel: Jashin-chan Dropkick Episode 12', ""Other: Jashin-chan Dropkick': Chitose-hen""]"	['Hanazono, Yurine', 'Jashin-chan', 'Pekora', 'Minos', 'Medusa', 'Devil A', 'Persephone II', 'Poporon', 'Kouji', 'Tachibana, Mei']	['Oomori, Nichika', 'Suzuki, Aina', 'Kozakai, Yurie', 'Omigawa, Chiaki', 'Kubota, Miyu', 'Yusa, Kouji', 'Iida, Riho', 'Sasaki, Rico', 'Terada, Miko', 'Hara, Natsuko']	[['Satou, Hikaru', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Imaizumi, Yuuichi', 'Sound Director'], ['Kakuchi, Takudai', 'Episode Director, Storyboard'], ['Yamada, Taku', 'Episode Director, Storyboard']]
