Dragon Half	OVA	2	03/26/1993	03/26/1993	18328	6.85	10164	4414	4155	Mink is no ordinary teenage girl, being half-human and half-dragon. Her father had fallen in love with a red dragon he intended to kill, and instead of slaying the dragon, he married her. Their union gave birth to Mink, who inherited horns, a tail, retractable wings, and incredible strengthâ€”characteristics which signify her dragon half nature. Mink spends her days accompanied by her friend Pia, a dwarf girl with overprotective parents, and her best friend Lufa, an elf with great healing powers but impressively bad magic. The three find themselves mooning over the dreamy and charming dragonslayer, Dick Saucer. But in a sudden, absurd turn of events, Mink gets closer than ever to the object of her fantasies, only to realize that her love may never be reciprocated because of her dragon heritage.Thus, the trio sets out on a quest to find a potion that will make Mink fully human. They may unwittingly make enemies, but they are sure to have one heck of a good time.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Adaptation: Dragon Half']	['Mink', 'Lufa', 'Pia', 'Damaramu', 'Saucer, Dick', 'Vena', 'Rouce the Red Lightning', 'Rosario', 'King Siva', 'Minotaurus']	['Mitsuishi, Kotono', 'Kouda, Mariko', 'Kawata, Taeko', 'Ootsuka, Akio', 'Matsumoto, Yasunori', 'Sakuma, Rei', 'Aono, Takeshi', 'Shiozawa, Kaneto', 'Ogata, Kenichi', 'Tomita, Kousuke']	[['Ishikawa, Mitsuhisa', 'Producer'], ['Sasaki, Shirou', 'Producer'], ['Sadamitsu, Shinya', 'Director, Episode Director, Script, Storyboard'], ['Mitsuishi, Kotono', 'Theme Song Performance']]
