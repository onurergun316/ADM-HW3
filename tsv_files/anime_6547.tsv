Android Ana Maico 2010	TV	24	04/06/1998	04/06/1998	3101	6.42	924	6551	8293	In the year 2010, the Japanese radio industry is in decline. To reverse their flagging ratings, a station staffed with perennial losers makes a daring gamble: to hire the industry's first android on-air host. Maico is cute, but it will take more than novelty to win over the fickle audience -- especially with a crew as inept as this one.
