Why	Movie	1	01/01/1975	-	397	4.94	187	11539	13590	A boxing ring turns into a stage for abstract animation where the punches thrown in the match and the halftone dots in reprographics gradually become indistinguishable. Tanaami shot a boxing match on a Motordrive camera, made two thousand offset prints, and rephotographed each of them. He explains his inspiration for the work being the experience of watching a boxing match on television but finding the newspaper print the next morning better capturing the exhilaration of the sport.(Source: Collaborative Cataloging Japan)	['Alternative version: Why Re-Mix 2002']	[]	[]
