Uramichi Oniisan	TV	13	07/06/2021	07/06/2021	126731	7.77	35707	910	1344	"In the studio of the morning childrens' show ""Together with Mama,"" a crew of miserable adults prepares their facades of amicable smiles and cheerful exteriors to educate a group of innocent preschoolers. In the middle of it stands Uramichi Omota, a former gymnast who can't help but bring the kids down to earth by revealing the harsh and depressing reality of adulthood, even in front of the rolling cameras.Behind the scenes, Uramichi's much-desired peace is disturbed by his two bothersome juniors who work as the show's rabbit and bear mascots and singers: Utano Tadano, a woman who only wishes to get married; and Iketeru Daga, a handsome man with a crass sense of humor. From smoking and exercising to nihilistic outbursts, everyone's big brother Uramichi always brings up the not-so-moral side to his life lessons.[Written by MAL Rewrite]"	['Adaptation: Uramichi Oniisan']	['Omota, Uramichi', 'Daga, Iketeru', 'Kumatani, Mitsuo', 'Usahara, Tobikichi', 'Kikaku, Hanbee', 'Tadano, Utano', 'Sayuri', 'Nekota, Matahiko', 'Capellini, Furitsuke', 'Edei, Eddie']	['Kamiya, Hiroshi', 'Miyano, Mamoru', 'Nakamura, Yuuichi', 'Sugita, Tomokazu', 'Kimura, Ryouhei', 'Mizuki, Nana', 'Sadaoka, Sayuri', 'Ono, Daisuke', 'Nakai, Kazuya', 'Hanae, Natsuki']	[['Nagayama, Nobuyoshi', 'Director'], ['Koizumi, Kisuke', 'Sound Director'], ['Miyano, Mamoru', 'Theme Song Performance, Inserted Song Performance'], ['Mizuki, Nana', 'Theme Song Performance, Inserted Song Performance']]
