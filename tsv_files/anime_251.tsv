Quanzhi Gaoshou Specials	ONA	3	04/27/2018	04/27/2018	89765	8.27	45034	251	1764	The All-Star Tournament is a three-day event that allows e-sports participants from various professional clubs to display their skills, while also giving casual Glory players the chance to interact with pros in the flesh.Retired top-tier Glory player Ye Xiu agrees to watch the tournament together with Tang Rou and Chen Guo after the latter manages to get ahold of three tickets. It is a strange sensation for Ye Xiu, as unlike previous occasions, this time he attends the tournament as a spectator, not a participant. However, despite his attempts to keep a low profile, events in the All-Star Tournament may force the former Glory legend back into the limelight.[Written by MAL Rewrite]	['Prequel: Quanzhi Gaoshou', 'Sequel: Quanzhi Gaoshou 2']	['Ye, Xiu', 'Su, Mucheng', 'Tang, Rou', 'Chen, Guo', 'Huang, Shaotian', 'Qiao, Yifan', 'Wang, Jiexi', 'Yu, Wenzhou', 'Sun, Xiang', 'Su, Muqiu']	[]	[['Shi, Juansheng', 'Director, Episode Director, Key Animation, Character Design, Chief Animation Director'], ['Butterfly Blue', 'Original Creator']]
