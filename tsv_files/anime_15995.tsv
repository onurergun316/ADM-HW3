He tends to confuse his surroundings beginning with his unique name, but surprisingly his job is upholding law and order as policeman; however, his way of life as modern time policeman leaves his superiors, civilians and even criminals dumbfounded. It's the new type of police comedy the Heisei-era has brought forth.(Source: Translation from NicoNico Douga, edited)	['Adaptation: Heisei Policemen!!']	['Gou, Gou']	['Yamaguchi, Kappei']	[['Araki, Hideki', 'Director'], ['Inaba, So-he-', 'Original Creator']]
