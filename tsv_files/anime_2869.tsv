Denki-gai no Honya-san	TV	12	10/02/2014	10/02/2014	116784	7.2	46161	2871	1433	Umio is a shy kid who just started his part time job at a manga store smack dab in the middle of the city. But his lifestyle isn't as glamorous as the neon lights that illuminate the city. Umio's closest friends are his co-workers who are all unique characters, to say the least, and although they're nice people, they have their quirks. They are a tight knit group of friends, have nicknames for each other and spend their weekends inside, sheltered from the extravagant scene happening on the outside.(Source: MU)	['Adaptation: Denki-gai no Honya-san']	['Sensei', 'Kameko', 'Sommelier', 'Fu Girl', 'Hio-tan', 'Kantoku', 'Umio', 'Erohon G-Men', 'Tsumori, Haruka', 'Umanami-chan']	['Tsuda, Minami', 'Aizawa, Mai', 'Tomita, Takahiro', 'Taketatsu, Ayana', 'Takamori, Natsumi', 'Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu', 'Oosaka, Ryouta', 'Kobayashi, Yuu', 'Satou, Satomi', 'Iizuka, Mayu']	[['Moriwaki, Makoto', 'Producer, Script'], ['Satou, Masafumi', 'Director, Episode Director, Storyboard, Theme Song Lyrics'], ['Hiramitsu, Takuya', 'Sound Director'], ['Enatsu, Yuki', 'Script']]
