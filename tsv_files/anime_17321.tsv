Nothing she does ever comes out right, and she receives a scolding from her father every day. Her only relief is the trust she places in her prayers to the gods. One day while at Fushimi Inari shrine, she meets a freewheeling young man named Kihachi Sakamoto. He rejects the gods, and boasts of the incoming age of electricity.The topic of marriage suddenly comes up in Inako's household.

The only way to stop her marriage is to find an unusual book called the ""Electricity Catalog.""
